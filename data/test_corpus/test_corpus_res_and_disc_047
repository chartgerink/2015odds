"The average age of the study participants was 30.5 yrs (median 30 yrs, range 18–56 yrs) with a significant gender difference (females: mean 23.1 yrs, range 18–45 yrs; males: mean 32.9 yrs, range 18–56 yrs, t-test-p<0.001). The mean duration of i.v. drug use for all participants was 8.5 yrs (median 7 yrs, range 0.1–40 yrs) with females having a significantly shorter history of drug use than males (males: 10.3 yrs, females: 3.4 yrs, t-test-p<0.001). The overall life-time history of sharing injection paraphernalia was 62% (males: 69%, females: 40%, χ2-p<0.001). When the study population was stratified into groups injecting for ≤5 yrs, 6–9 yrs and ≥10 yrs, the proportion of those reporting a history of sharing injection paraphernalia was 39.8%, 65.8% and 81.8% respectively (χ2-p<0.001).The study revealed that 69% of all participants had a history of imprisonment (males: 84%, females: 23%, χ2-p<0.001) with 29% experiencing ≥ 1 month of imprisonment and 8% experiencing ≥ 1 year. Overall, 14% of participants (males: 7.7%, females: 33%, χ2-p<0.001) had exchanged sex for money or drugs in the past and 56% (males: 58%, females: 49%, χ2-p = 0.11) had intra-cutaneous tattoos or a history of ritual cutting.
HIV
There were 43 participants who were also registered at “SPARSHA Nepal”, which is an NGO which exclusively serves people living with HIV. Participants from this centre were excluded from the statistical analysis of HIV prevalence to eliminate this obvious selection bias. An additional 4 participants refused an HIV test. Consequently, 354 participants were included in the analysis of HIV prevalence.
After exclusion of the participants from SPARSHA, the overall HIV prevalence in the cohort was 13.8% (95% CI: 10–18%) (Table 1). The differences were not statistically significant—females had lower rates than males, and those living in the mid-western Nepalguni region had lower rates than those in the central and eastern regions. 10.1371/journal.pone.0134455.t001

Besides other factors (region and history of sharing injecting paraphernalia), the duration of injecting drug use (in years) was the strongest significant predictor of the presence of anti-HIV antibodies in a logistic regression model (Exp(B) 1,215, p<0.001). When stratified into groups of people injecting for ≤5 yrs, 6–9 yrs and ≥10 yrs, the prevalence of anti-HIV antibodies was 3.6%, 13.9% and 43.6%, respectively (χ2-p<0.001). HBV
Lifetime exposure to HBV (anti-HBc antibodies) was found in 43.8% of the study population (95% CI: 39–49%). Besides other factors (age and region), the duration of injecting drug use (in years) was the strongest significant predictor of presence of anti-HBc antibodies in a logistic regression model (Exp(B) 1,178, p<0.001). When stratified in groups of people injecting for ≤5 yrs, 6–9 yrs and ≥10 yrs, the prevalence of anti-HBc antibodies was 22.4%, 43.8% and 65.4%, respectively (χ2-p<0.001). The overall HBV prevalence (HBsAg positive) was 3.5% (95% CI: 2–6%) (Table 2) with a non-significant trend (p = 0.07) towards higher rates in the Terai regions (Biratnagar and Dharan in the eastern region and Nepalgunj in western region) versus the central region (Lalitpur and Kathmandu). Of the 401 participants, 78 (19.5%) had anti-HBs antibodies as markers of naturally- or vaccination-acquired immunity. 10.1371/journal.pone.0134455.t002

Regional difference (Central vs. ‘other’) for HBsAg non-significant χ2-p = 0.07. A total of 31% of all HBsAg-negative participants showed an “isolated anti-HBc antibodies” pattern (i.e. anti-HBc antibody positive and HBsAg/anti-HBs antibody negative), and 6.3% of all participants tested positive for isolated anti-HBs antibodies after vaccination. Of the 26 people who stated having been vaccinated against HBV in the past, the following results were observed: 2 (7.7%) were HBsAg postive, 4 (15.4%) were isolated anti-HBc antibody carriers, 6 (23.1%) were naturally immune (anti-HBc and anti-HBs antibodies), and 7 (27%) had neither anti-HBc nor anti-HBs antibodies. Seven individuals (27%) had isolated anti-HBs antibodies. Details about HBV/HCV co-infection are discussed in the section below.
Antiretroviral treatment with 3TC and/or TDF is the standard first line therapy for HIV in Nepal. 3TC and/or TDF are induce HBs-seroconversion within 7 years in up to 10% of people with chronic HBV-infection [33]. However, we did not assess levels of ART use for the study participants. Among all participants with anti-HBc antibodies and known HIV status, HBsAg was present in 5 of the 70 HIV-positive (7.1%) participants and 9 of the 103 HIV-negative (8.7%) participants (Fisher’s exact-p = 0.78). HCV
The overall prevalence of anti-HCV antibodies in the tested population was 49.9%. Besides other factors (age, region, history of imprisonment and history of sharing injection paraphernalia) the duration of i.v. drug use (in years) was the strongest significant predictor for the presence of anti-HCV antibodies in a logistic regression (Exp(B) 1,326, p<0.001). When stratified into groups of people injecting for ≤5 yrs, 6–9 yrs and ≥10 yrs, prevalence of anti-HCV antibodies was 19.3%, 46.6% and 84.3%, respectively (χ2-p<0.001).
The prevalence of HCV-RNA was 41.9% (95% CI: 37–47%) with significantly higher rates in the central and eastern regions than in the western region (Nepalgunj) (49.7% vs 16.5%, χ2-p<0.01) (Table 3). HCV-RNA prevalence correlated significantly with age (Fig 1). A logistic regression analysis was used to analyse the factors associated with HCV infection and to predict the HCV-RNA positivity. Independent variables included (1) history of imprisonment, (2) duration of injecting drug use, (3) age, (4) region, (5) gender and (6) HIV status (Table 4). 10.1371/journal.pone.0134455.g001

Gender? (Female: 1; Male = 0) A test of the full model against a constant-only model was statistically significant indicating that the predictors reliably distinguished between those who were living with HCV and those who were not (χ2 = 277.7, p<0.001 with df = 7). A Nagelkerke’s R2 of 0.69 indicated that there was a moderately strong relationship between prediction and grouping. A Hosmer and Lemeshow test produced a p = 0.775, indicating that the model provided a good fit to the data. The Wald criterion demonstrated that all parameters made a significant contribution to the model prediction (p≤0.001). Seven “outliers” were removed from the model. The prediction formula was given as: p=e(−5.997+0.15×Started+1.563×Prison+0.084×Age+3.142×East+2,464×Central+1×Western+2.764×HIV−1.968×Female)1+e(−5.997+0.15×Started+1.563×Prison+0.084×Age+3.142×East+2,464×Central+1×Western+2.764×HIV−1.968×Female) Prediction success was 86.5% (91.2% for HCV-negativity and 80% for HCV-positivity) with an overall cut-off value of p = 0.5. Persistence and spontaneous clearance of HCV
Of the 200 patients who were reactive for anti-HCV antibodies, 32 (16%, 95% CI: 12–22%) experienced spontaneous HCV-clearance (anti-HCV positive and HCV-RNA negative). This spontaneous clearance occurred in 43.5% of those ≤24 yrs (Fig 2). In a logistic regression model for all participants with anti-HCV antibodies, the persistence of HCV-RNA correlated significantly with age (p = 0.01, Exp(B) = 1.071, 95% CI: 1.016–1.128). 10.1371/journal.pone.0134455.g002
Fig 2 Rate of spontaneous clearance stratified by age and HIV status.
Rate of spontaneous clearance of HCV is associated with age (spontaneous clearance associated with age: χ2-p<0.001) and HIV status (spontaneous clearance associated with HIV-status in “all” patients: two-sided Fischer’s Exact p = 0.03, error bars show 95% CI). The spontaneous HCV clearance rate was significantly lower in people living with HIV (people living without HIV: 21.6%, 95% CI: 15–30%; people living with HIV: 10%, 95% CI: 5–18%, Fisher’s exact-p = 0.025) (Fig 2). In our study, the gender differences in spontaneous HCV clearance disappeared when adjusting for age. HCV genotypes
HCV genotypes(HCV-GT) were determined in 164 of the 168 HCV-RNA positive participants and HCV-GT remained undetermined in 4 samples. Of the 164 samples with a determined HCV-GT, 66 were HCV-GT 1 (40.2%), and 98 were HCV-GT 3 (59.8%) (Fig 3). There was no significant difference in HCV-GT in terms of gender or region (Table 5). Subtype 3b was found exclusively in the eastern region where 25.8% of all HCV-GT3 infections were caused by subtype 3b, and the remaining 74.2% were caused by subtype 3a. All HCV-GT 3 viruses were subtype 3a in the other two regions and one undefined GT3 subtype was found in the central region. The phylogenetic tree of the 5UTR region (Fig 4) of the HCV isolates showed a genotype-specific clustering within samples and with reference samples from isolates of India, China and Thailand. 10.1371/journal.pone.0134455.g003

Only 3 of the 401 participants were found to have an HBsAg-positive HBV infection and an RNA-positive HCV infection on the day of examination (0.75%). Two of these patients were also living with HIV (“triple infection”).
Of all participants who were found to be reactive for anti-HCV antibodies, 70% of those living with HBV (HBsAg positive) experienced spontaneous HCV clearance, while only 13.7% of HBsAG-negative participants experienced a spontaneous HCV clearance. (Fisher’s exact-p<0.001) (Fig 5). However, HBV-status was not statistically significantly associated with the very high rates of spontaneous HCV-clearance in the age group ≤24 yrs. 10.1371/journal.pone.0134455.g005
Fig 5 Rate of spontaneous clearance stratified by HBsAg-status.
Spontaneous HCV clearance among people living with HBsAg is significantly higher versus people who are negative for HBsAg. (Two-sided Fisher exact p<0.001, error bars show 95% CI). When only people with both anti-HBc antibodies and anti-HCV antibodies are analysed (n = 140), the “isolated anti-HBc”-pattern was found in 71.6% of people with HCV-persistence and 41.7% with spontaneous HCV clearance (Fisher’s exact-p = 0.008). HBsAg was diagnosed in 29.2% of people with spontaneous HCV clearance and 2.6% of people with HCV-persistence (Fisher’s exact-p<0.001) (Table 6) 10.1371/journal.pone.0134455.t006

HIV/HCV co-infection
Of the 397 participants with known HIV-status, 72 (18.1%) were living with an HIV/HCV co-infection (HCV-RNA and anti-HIV-antibodies) (Fig 6). Participants living with HIV had an HCV-RNA-positivity rate of 84.7%, whilst HIV-negative participants showed an HCV-RNA-positivity rate of 29.5% (χ2-p<0.001). 10.1371/journal.pone.0134455.g006
Fig 6 Percentage of frequencies of HIV and HCV mono- and co-infection.
At 3.3%, HIV mono-infection is a comparatively rare constellation whereas HIV/HCV co-infection is found in 18.1% of all participants (n = 397). IL28B
IL28B SNPs rs12979860 and rs8099917 were determined in 122 participants—20 were anti-HCV antibody reactive and HCV-RNA negative (“spontaneous clearance”) and 102 were HCV-RNA positive (Table 7). IL28B rs8099917 T/T is associated with a higher rate of spontaneous clearance—all 20 patients with spontaneous clearance (anti-HCV antibody reactive, HCV-RNA negative) had rs8099917 T/T whilst 20 out of 102 (19.7%) patients currently living with HCV (anti-HCV-antibody reactive, HCV-RNA positive) had IL28B rs8099917 G/T (Fisher’s exact-p = 0.04). Participants for the IL28B assessment were selected to examine its effect on the natural course of the HCV-infection. However, the 30 participants with heterozygote IL28B alleles in one or both IL28B SNPs also had a non-significant trend towards impaired clearance of HBsAg versus carriers of IL28B rs12979860-CC/rs8099917-T/T (Fisher’s exact-p = 0.09). 10.1371/journal.pone.0134455.t007

0% N = 122 This study is a baseline assessment to tailor a country-specific response to viral hepatitis among people who inject drugs in Nepal. The results detail the current infection rates among people who inject drugs and seek health care; they do not constitute a nationally representative prevalence survey. Versus national surveillance data (CBS-studies) among people who use drugs, the average age of the participants in our study (30.5 yrs) is higher than the average age of all people who inject drugs in Nepal. The average duration of i.v. drug use (8.5 yrs) is also longer than the average age of those interviewed for the CBS studies (CBS average age is 25.07 yrs with 66% reporting drug use for ≤5 yrs) [1]. The prevalence rates of HBsAg, HIV and anti-HCV antibodies were 3.5%, 13.8% and 49.9%. These figures are 4-, 50- and 100-times higher than the reported national averages. The national figures are mostly based on data from blood donation centres and the “2011-Integrated Biological and Behavioural Surveillance” (IBBS) HIV study [3]. The latter was based on a respondent-driven sample in Pokhara (western region) and Kathmandu. In contrast to our study, this data suggested that the prevalence of HIV among people who inject drugs was as low as 4.6% and 6.3% [3].In comparison to previous studies [22, 23], our estimates for 2013 suggest that the prevalence of anti-HCV antibodies and HCV-RNA is lower—only 49.9% and 41.9%, respectively. The lower rates of anti-HCV antibodies in our sample could have several explanations: (1) females accounted for 25% of our study participants whereas the female/male ratio among people who inject drugs in Nepal is usually much lower (e.g. <5–8%) in respondent-driven samples [1, 3]. In our study, HCV prevalence among women who use drugs was also much lower than among men, which is similar to results from an UNODC study from 2011 that found that 15.2% of women who inject drugs were anti-HCV antibody positive [24]. (2) The lower HCV prevalence found might also reflect a reduction in HCV incidence resulting from the establishment of harm-reduction services. Sharing needles with others was reported by only 5% of participants in 2011, whereas the comparable figures for the Kathmandu valley in 2002 and 2005 were 59% and 27%, respectively [3]. The idea that there has been a reduction in HCV incidence is supported by the fact that 80.7% of people in our study who had injected drugs for ≤ 5 yrs had never contracted HCV, whereas 84.3% of those who had injected for ≥ 10 yrs had anti-HCV antibodies. Previous assessments found that without preventive interventions, HCV infection usually occurs very quickly after initiation of i.v. drug use [34, 35]. The low rate of anti-HCV antibodies among people with a history of injecting drugs for ≤5 yrs is paralleled by similar reductions in individuals’ history of sharing injection paraphernalia as well as lower rates of anti-HIV and anti-HBc antibodies. (3) A persistently high level of mortality is another factor that could account for the comparatively low prevalence of HCV in our study. In 2011, there were 4,722 HIV-related deaths among people living with HIV—this constitutes 9.4% of the overall number of people living with HIV in Nepal. This is one of the highest proportions of any country in the world [36, 37].Here, we defined a logistic regression formula that enables us to discriminate between those with the highest and lowest pre-test probability of HCV where HCV-laboratory testing is not readily available.Almost 50% of people ≤ 24 yrs who are living with anti-HCV achieved spontaneous clearance (defined as anti-HCV antibody positive but HCV-RNA negative). This rate is higher than the previously reported rates for most other settings or ethnicities [38, 39]. The high rate of spontaneous clearance could be explained at least in part by the favourable IL28B SNPs [40]. We found favourable IL28B SNP rs12979860 and rs8099917 in 76.2% and 83.6% of participants; 75% of participants had favourable variants in both IL28B SNPs. These findings are in line with Firdaus et al.’s study of different population groups in eastern and north-eastern parts of India [30]. We found a significant correlation between IL28B rs8099917 T/T and spontaneous clearance. Because homozygote IL28B rs12979860-C/C and -rs8099917-T/T are associated with high SVR rates after treatment with pegIFN/RBV, our data supports increased availability of HCV-treatment programs [10–13, 30].The 60:40% ratio of HCV-GT3/GT1 among people with RNA-positive HCV infection is also in line with the findings of Firdaus et al. In their work, they reported a 66:32% distribution from eastern and north-eastern India [35]. The genotype-specific clustering of the HCV isolates indicates absolute genetic relatedness regardless of geographic origin.Hepatitis B is a relatively rare infection in Nepal versus the neighbouring countries India and China [41, 42]. The overall prevalence in the general population has repeatedly been found to be <2% [43]. This pattern is confirmed by our findings where even in a high-risk population, the prevalence of HBsAg was just 3.3%. However, we found a high rate of anti-HBc antibodies (49.1%) in our cohort, which illustrates an increased risk of infection. It is possible that this mainly occurs during adolescence and adulthood and leads to an acute hepatitis B with subsequent HBsAG clearance. However, our findings also support previous reports that HBV and HCV can, to a certain degree, suppress each other’s replication [34, 40]. Furthermore the high rate of “isolated anti-HBc” patterns especially among people living with HIV or HCV might indicate that there is a relevant proportion of occult HBV infection [44].HCV/HIV co-infection is common, and 18% of all participants in the study were found to be HIV/HCV co-infected. HIV accelerates the progress of HCV-induced liver disease [9] and putting HIV/HCV co-infected patients on effective ART seems to lessen this effect [45, 46]. While the WHO currently states that no general recommendation can be given to start ART earlier in patients living with HCV/HIV co-infection [47], it is important to include HCV care into the spectrum of services for people living with HIV. This is especially true in Nepal: 85% of all people who inject drugs and live with HIV were co-infected with HCV, and only 13 (3.3%) of the 397 HIV-tested participants presented with an HIV mono-infection.In conclusion, the study shows that the potential HCV treatment needs for people who inject drugs in Nepal are lower in absolute numbers than anticipated. Furthermore, we infer that it is reasonable to expect high SVR rates for treatment with pegIFN/RBV because most patients living with HCV are infected with GT3 and have a combination of favourable IL28B SNPs. Finally, we conclude that HCV/HIV co-infection is frequent in Nepal whereas HIV mono-infection is rare. As such, all people living with HIV should be screened, diagnosed and evaluated for HCV therapy. Clinicians should consider initiating ART shortly after infection.
Limitations
The study sample does not constitute a representative sample of all people who use or inject drugs in Nepal. The study only covers individuals living in Dharan, Biratnagar, Kathmandu, Lalitpur, Chitwan, and Nepalgunj. However, there are also other places with non-ignorable numbers of people who use drugs (Pokhara, Budwal, Birganj and the far-western region). The sample is also not representative for all people who inject drugs in the regions where our study was conducted. In particular, the study sample over-represents females and only includes people with health-care seeking behaviour. As a consequence, the study tends to include older participants with a comparatively longer duration of i.v. drug use. It is likely that our HIV-prevalence estimate is actually rather conservative because we excluded participants registered with SPARSHA for the estimation of HIV-prevalence. This is especially true when considering HIV-prevalence in the central valley (Kathmandu and Lalitpur) where people living with HIV are mainly concentrated at SPARSHA.
The technique that was used to sequence a 150 bp sequence of the 5’UTR region of the viral genome failed to define HCV GT in 4 of the 168 HCV-RNA positive samples."
