"896 Chinese subjects were involved in this study, including 529 subjects with persistent HCV infection, 196 subjects who cleared the infection and 171 healthy controls.

The frequencies of the key gene polymorphisms of IL28B; rs12979860, rs8099917, rs8103142 and rs12980275 were investigated in 303 subjects with persistent infection and 96 individuals who spontaneously cleared the virus (data not shown). The linkage disequilibrium (LD) and haplotype analysis with the four SNPs were performed. The result shows that these SNPs were in complete LD (D′ = 0.99–1; r2 = 0.97–0.98), therefore, the rs12979860 was selected as a tag SNP in the subsequent studies.The distribution of the alleles of rs12979860 was in accordance with the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in this study (P = 0.51). We confirmed that the rs12979860 C allele frequency in this healthy Chinese population was 95%. The C allele was significantly lower in the persistent infection group (95.3%) than in the clearance group (97.7%) (Tab.1). However, the frequency of the T allele was greater among individuals of the persistent infection group than those of the clearance group (4.7% vs 2.3%; P = 0.04) (Tab. 1).We further determined the association of the gene variants with spontaneous viral clearance by logistic regression (Tab. 2). Since there were fewer individuals with TT genotype of rs12979860 in this study we combined TT with TC genotype together for statistical analysis. As shown in Tab. 2, spontaneous HCV clearance was more common in subjects carrying the CC genotype than CT/TT genotype (P = 0.04, OR = 2.12, 95% CI = 1.01–4.42). The influence of sex and HBV co-infection was also determined by logistic regression (Tab. 2). Sex differences in the rate of spontaneous viral clearance were also observed; females appeared to be more effective in spontaneous viral clearance than males (P = 0.002). HBsAg status was also associated with spontaneous viral clearance (HBsAg negative vs positive: P = 0.001, OR = 2.85, 95% CI = 1.56–5.22 and male vs female: P = 0.002, OR = 1.72, 95% CI = 1.23–2.41). (Tab. 2).The correlation between rs12979860 SNPs and virus load in chronic HCV subjects was further analysised. There was no association between IL-28B genotype and virus load in the whole patients (including genotype 1b or 2a), (data not shown). We did the test of interaction between viral genotype and IL28B genotype by Factorial design ANOVA, there is not statistical significance (P = 0.77).The causative effect of rs12979860 variants on host resistance/susceptiblity to HCV infection is currently unknown. One possibility is that this gene variant upstream of the IL28B gene may affect IL-28B protein production. We then determined and compared the IL-28B levels in persistent, clearance and healthy control groups by ELISA. The IL-28B expression levels were comparable between the healthy control and clearance groups (Fig. 1A). However, the levels of IL-28B were markedly reduced in the persistent group compared to the spontaneous clearance and healthy control groups (Fig. 1A, persistent vs clearance, P = 0.003; persistent vs healthy control, P = 0.04). When stratified with respect to rs12979860 genotypes in overall subjects, IL-28B levels were significantly higher in CC homozygous than TT/TC home- or heterozygous (P = 0.02) (Fig. 1B). This was also the case in spontaneous clearance group (P = 0.013) but not in the healthy control or persistent groups (Fig. 1C). We also determined the mRNA levels of IL28A/B in PBMCs from different subjects by qRT-PCR. Our results showed that similar to the protein data in Fig. 1A and B, the levels of IL-28A/B mRNA were markedly reduced in the persistent group compared to the healthy control group (Fig. S2.A, persistent vs healthy control, P<0.001). When stratified with respect to rs12979860 genotypes, IL-28A/B levels were significantly higher in CC homozygous than TT/TC home- or heterozygous (P<0.001) (Fig. S2.B). 10.1371/journal.pone.0037054.g001 Figure 1 The association of serum levels of IL-28B with different outcomes of HCV infection and IL28B variants. IL-28B serum levels were determined by ELISA (A): compares the serum IL-28B levels among the persistent (n = 143), clearance (n = 56) and healthy control (n = 28) groups. (B): the association of IL-28B levels with rs12979860 alleles in all 227 subjects. (C): the IL28B serum levels in subjects carrying different alleles in different experimental groups. Data are median (quartile range) and are representative of two experiments. Transaminase levels indirectly reflect the liver function and host immune activation [28]. We next determined the levels of transaminase and their association with IL28B gene variants and the levels of serum IL-28B in chronic HCV subjects.We assessed and compared the transaminase levels among the 896 subjects with persistent, cleared HCV infection or the healthy controls. We confirmed that the levels of ALT, AST and GGT were significantly higher in subjects with chronic HCV infection than those in individuals who cleared the infection and healthy controls (P<0.05) (Tab. 1). We further associated the levels of transaminase with IL28B variants in patients with persistent HCV infection (Fig. 2). The levels of AST were significantly higher in the patients carrying the rs12979860 T allele than the CC homozygous in the persistent group (P = 0.02, Fig. 2). However, no significant difference in their levels of ALT or GGT between CC and TC/TT carriers was found (data not shown). 10.1371/journal.pone.0037054.g002 Figure 2 The association of rs12979860 with AST levels in chronic HCV patients. The AST levels were determined using a Synchron LX®20 autoanalyser. The AST levels were higher in patients carrying the T-allele. Data are mean±SD and representative of two experiments. The correlation between the levels of serum IL-28B and transaminase was also determined in 146 chronic HCV patients with high (ALT:>50 IU/ml; AST>40 IU/ml) or normal (ALT:≤50 IU/ml; AST:≤40 IU/ml) levels of transaminase. As shown in Fig. S1; there was a significant increase in IL-28B levels in chronic HCV patients with high levels of transaminase ALT and AST compared to those with normal levels (P = 0.001. Fig. S1A and B). In addition, there was no significant difference in IL-28B levels found between male and female subjects (P = 0.13) (data not shown). Further analysis revealed that there were also no significant differences in IL-28B levels between the HCV patients with high and low levels of HCV load, high and normal levels of total cholesterol (TC) or triglyceride (TG) or infected with 1b and 2a genotypes HCV (data not shown).Finally, we associated the IL28B polymorphisms with treatment response in 235 Chinese HCV subjects. The general information, basic demographic and virological features of the patients was displayed in Table 3. The RVR, EVR and cEVR rates to interferon-α2b and ribavirin treatment were 43.4%, 91.1% and 72.3%, respectively.the IL28B CC genotype increased the proportion of patients who attained cEVR, but not RVR (P>0.05), in Fig. 3, (cEVR = 75.7% for CC vs 38.1% for TC/TT, P = 0.0001). The HCV patients with IL28B CC genotype significantly increased cEVR, to a less extent, RVR to the treatment compared to the ones with TC/TT (Fig. 3). Furthermore, the multivariate logistic regression analysis further confirmed that the CC genotype was significantly associated with cEVR compared to TC/TT group (Table 4). 10.1371/journal.pone.0037054.g003 Figure 3 The association of IL28B genotype with response to IFN/RBV treatment. 235 chronic HCV patients underwent IFN/RBV treatment were involved in the study. the definition of RVR and cEVR was described in M&M. The IL28B CC genotype was significantly associated with RVR and cEVR. 10.1371/journal.pone.0037054.t003Table 3 Baseline characteristics of the patients treated with IFN/RBV.

The data presented here demonstrates that the rs12979860 polymorphism of IL28B locus is closely associated with the outcomes of HCV infection in Chinese population. In our data, the normal frequency of rs12979860 T allele was 5% in healthy control of Chinese population. The frequency of T allele (rs12979860) was significantly higher among individuals with persistent HCV than those with cleared infection. Sex, ethnicity, and coinfections with hepatitis B virus affect spontaneous HCV clearance [29].Even after adjustment for the gender and HBV infection in multivariate logistic regression, the CC and TC/TT of rs12979860 polymorphisms were still independently associated with spontaneous clearance and persistent HCV infection, respectively. The patients with TC and TT genotypes were two times less effective in their ability to clear HCV relative to patients with the CC genotypes (Tab. 2).This is consistent with the recent GWAS, which shown that IL28B gene variants including rs8099917 are associated with the spontaneous HCV clearance in European and African American subjects [17], [26], [27], [30]–[32].Intriguingly, the frequency of the protective rs12979860 CC-genotype is variable across the different ethnic groups; about 95% in Asia/Chinese population and approximately 55% and 51% in African and Europeans, respectively [17], [31]. Our result using a relative large cohort confirmed the result in Chinese population and suggested that IL28B polymorphism may represent a genetic advantage which confers anti-HCV immunity on the Asia/Chinese population. It may also provide a genetic explanation for the previous observations that while they seem to have similar HCV infection rate as other populations (about 3.2%), the Asian origin HCV patients appear to achieve better sustained virological response (SVR) rates when treated with PEG-IFN plus RBV compared to Caucasians [33]. It will be clinically important to reveal the detailed mechanism underlying the race influences on spontaneous virus clearance and antiviral treatment response.We also demonstrated that the IL28B allele is associated with response to interferon and ribavirin treatment in Chinese patients with HCV infection. The patients carrying rs12979860 CC genotype are more likely to achieve cEVR which are the important indicator/predictors for the success of treatment in HCV patients [34]–[37].The causative effect of rs12979860 polymorphisms on host protection against HCV infection is unknown. Since IL-28B possesses anti-viral activity and the SNPs were adjacent to the IL28B gene it has been suggested that the variants may associate with HCV infection by influencing IL-28B gene expression and protein production [38]. However, to date, little is known about the role of the gene variants in IL-28B production in HCV infection. Our results demonstrate that patients with chronic HCV infection had significantly lower mRNA and serum levels of IL-28B than subjects who spontaneously cleared the virus and the healthy controls. Individuals carrying protective rs12979860 CC genotype in general also tended to have higher IL-28B levels than those carrying the risk T-alleles in all subjects studied. Furthermore, the IL-28B levels were significantly higher in CC homozygous than the T homo- or heterozygous (P = 0.013) in the spontaneous clearance group. To support our finding, it has been reported that the rs8099917 T-protective allele was also associated with IL-28B mRNA expression in whole blood cells of healthy individuals [27]. These results suggest that IL28B variants can impact on IL-28B production which is correlated with host protection against HCV infection and that reduced IL-28B levels may be responsible for the chronicity of acute HCV infection.The rs12979860 allele is 3 kb upstream from the IL28B locus which also contains several genes, including IL28A and IL-29 [19], [21]. It is likely that the SNP may also affect the function of other genes in the locus. Indeed, it has been reported that this variant is associated with increased serum IL-29 and IL-28A/B levels and the resolution of HCV infection [39], [40].These results suggest that the variations upstream of IL28B gene may have an impact on the expression and production of all IFNλs, which may explain, at least in part, their profound association with the outcomes of HCV infection. Therefore, it is important to further elucidate the mechanism by which the gene variants regulate the expression of IFNλs in HCV infection.Transaminases are the key clinical assessments for liver function and immune activation in HCV patients. We found the levels of transaminases (ALT, AST) were higher in patients with risk rs12979860-TC or TT than C/C genotype, especially AST. We also noted that the chronic HCV patients with high serum levels of ALT and AST aminotransferase also had relatively higher levels of serum IL-28B production (Fig. S1). The physiopathological significance of the observations and the relationship between IL-28B and aminotransferase levels in HCV infection is unknown. Since IL-28B is involved in anti-virus immunity we reason that higher aminotransferase and IL-28B levels may reflect the virus-host interaction and ongoing anti-HCV immune activation in the hosts and may also be an additional predicator for the outcomes of chronic HCV infection.In conclusion, our results suggest that the SNP rs12979860 upstream of IL28B is associated with spontaneous clearance of HCV and treatment response in Chinese Han population. Furthermore, chronic HCV infection is associated with a reduced IL-28B production. Thus, IL-28B may represent a novel therapeutic agent against HCV and IL28B variations and IL-28B expression levels may help to predict the outcomes of HCV infection and treatment. Further research is needed to reveal the cause-effect of these polymorphisms on host protective immunity against HCV infection and the mechanism by which HCV downregulates IL-28B expression."
