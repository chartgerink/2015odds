"None of the SNPs of IL28B were Associated with SVR in GT2 Patients, though they were in GT1 Patients The demographic characteristics of these patients are shown in Table 1. There were 191 GT1 and 197 GT2 patients. More patients of GT1 had high viral load (HCV-RNA≥0.4×106 IU/ml) than GT2 patients (GT1 vs. GT2∶52.4% vs. 42.1%, p = 0.044). Other demographic data were comparable between these two groups. Similar to previous literature, the rates of RVR, cEVR and SVR were significantly lower in GT1 patients than GT2 patients (Table 1). The genotypic distributions of the six SNPs of IL28B were similar in GT1 and GT2 patients (Figure 1). Five (rs12979860, rs8099917, rs12980275, rs8105790, and rs7248668) of these six SNPs revealed significant association with SVR in GT1 patients. These SNPs had no influence on the SVR in GT2 patients (Figure 2). After balancing the covariates in GT1 and GT2 patients to reduce the bias possibility by the PSM (Table 2), all the treatment responses of GT1 were significantly lower than GT2 (SVR: 68.3% vs. 89.7%, P<0.001; RVR: 61.4% vs. 82.1%, P<0.001; cEVR: 70.3% vs. 86.9%, P = 0.001). As for the relationship between the SNPs of IL28B and the treatment responses (Figure 3), five out of the six SNPs showed significant association with RVR, cEVR and SVR in GT1 patients, but none of these SNPs had any relationship with treatment responses in GT2 patients. Different Predictors for RVR, cEVR and SVR in GT1 and GT2 Patients Because the SNPs of IL28B had different impacts on the treatment responses in GT1 and GT2 patients, we therefore analyzed the possible predictors for treatment responses in these two PSM adjusted patient groups. In the prediction of RVR, rs12979860 and baseline HCV RNA viral load were the independent predictors in GT1 patients, while baseline HCV-RNA viral load was the only predictor in GT2. In the cEVR prediction analysis, only RVR was the predictor in both GT1 and GT2 patients. As for the SVR, rs12979860, age, baseline viral load and RVR were the predictors in GT1 patients, while BMI, gender and baseline viral load were the predictors in GT2 patients (Table 3). In our previous report [27], we found that in GT1 patients with RVR, only baseline viral load could predict the SVR. As for GT1 patients without RVR, rs12979860 became the predictor for SVR. Similar observation was found in GT1 patients in this PSM analysis. However, in GT2 patients with RVR, baseline RNA, fibrosis and ALT levels were the predictors for SVR. Interestingly, none of these factors including SNPs of IL28B were associated with SVR in GT2 patients without RVR (Table 4). The treatment of CHC has evolved rapidly. Response to tailored treatment planning has been emphasized after a roadmap concept is established [2]. The discovery of the host genome factors of IL-28B was a milestone since it demonstrated and explained the influence of genetic variations and ethnicity on the efficacy of interferon-based therapy for patients with GT1 CHC [28], [29]. In our previous report, by genotyping six SNPs of IL28B, we had shown a significant correlation of genetic polymorphisms of IL28B with SVR in GT1 Asian patients [27]. The present study revealed that none of the six SNPs had association with either RVR or SVR in Asian GT2 patients, even by PSM approach.Though the impact of polymorphisms of IL28B on the treatment responses of GT1 patients is very clear, the impact of this genetic polymorphism on the treatment responses in GT2 patients is still controversial [18]–[22]. Rauch et al. had reported that genotype of rs8099917 had no significant impact on the SVR in Swiss patients infected with HCV GT2 or 3 [15]. Yu et al. [19] found no influence of rs8099917 on SVR of Asian HCV GT2 patients, but a higher RVR rate in those with TT rs8099917. On the other hand, in Italian patients, Mangia [18], Lindh [20] and Sarrazin [21] reported that the genotype of rs12979860 had significant association with SVR in patients with HCV GT2 or GT3 infection. Kawaoka [22] found that the initial viral load and rs8099917 genotype are significantly independent predictors of SVR in genotype 2 patients in Japan.The three reports [18], [20], [21] about the impact of IL28B on the treatment outcomes of chronic hepatitis C GT2 or GT3 patients showed IL28B polymorphism was associated with SVR in the 24-week treatment and the effect was only observed in the non-RVR patients. In one of them, Sarrazin et al. [21] claimed only GT3 but not GT2 patients had a significantly higher SVR rate in the patients with advantageous allele. The other two did not further divide their patients into GT2 and GT3 groups [18], [20]. However, genotype 2 and 3 are not really the same [30], [31]. Here, our patients are all GT2 HCV infections, and no associations between treatment outcomes (SVR or RVR) and rs12979860 polymorphism were found. In our study, the polymorphism of IL28B SNPs influences the RVR in GT1 patients rather than GT2 patients.In addition, the distribution of the homozygous responding allele was around 40% in Caucasians but it is the dominant pattern (about 90%) in our patients. Furthermore, the dosage of pegylated interferon and ribavirin varied among Western studies (PEG-INTRON: 1.0 or 1.5 mcg/kg/week; ribavirin: 600–1400 mg/day), and treatment duration varied from 12 weeks to 24 weeks. In the present study, we used a fixed dosage of PegIFN and RBV (PEG-INTRON: 1.5 mcg/kg/week or pegasys 180 mcg/week; ribavirin: 1000–1200 mg/day), and a fixed duration (24 weeks). These factors may also contribute to the different conclusions in different studies.To investigate the association between SNPs and treatment outcome in an observational database rather than a randomized control trial, a propensity score matching analysis was an important method used to reduce patient selection bias [24]–[26] and to avoid imbalance covariates between groups. Through PSM, we used GT1 patients as a comparison group to match covariates that had been reported to influence treatment responses between GT1 and GT2 patient groups. The results still demonstrated the SNPs (rs12979860, rs8099917, rs12980275, rs8105790, and rs7248668) had no relationship with SVR in GT2 patients, though they had significant impact on SVR in GT1 patients. Therefore, it is fair to claim that the genotype of IL28B had great impact on the treatment response only in GT1 patients but not GT2 patients. In addition, till now only two SNPs of IL28B, rs8809917 and rs12979860, had been investigated in GT2 patients. We studied six SNPs of IL28B that had been published before [13]–[16] and found that none of these SNPs had any relationship with the treatment responses in GT2 patients.In previous studies [7], [32], [33] and ours focusing on GT1 patients [27], the genetic variants of IL28B SNP had a more significant impact on SVR in patients without RVR rather than those with RVR. However, in the present studies, the genetic variants of IL28B SNP did not influence the treatment outcome in both the RVR group and non-RVR group in GT2 patients using propensity score matching analysis. Similar results were found by Yu [19], also done in an Asian population, that the SNP of IL28B had no impact on SVR in GT2 patients, whether RVR had been achieved or not.Much better response rates (RVR, cEVR and SVR) have been demonstrated in GT2 patients than GT1 patients. The stronger sensitivity of HCV GT2 to PR might offset the increasing response to PR by IL28B, even for those GT2 patients with no RVR, though two reports from Europe [18], [20] showed that the SNP of IL28B had a significant impact on SVR in GT2 or GT3 patients who did not achieve RVR. The majority of their patients were genotype 3 and the response to PR treatment was not as good in genotype 3 as it was in genotype 2. Therefore, further studies on the association of IL28B and SVR in only genotype 2 Caucasian patients are needed.The limitation of this study is that the sample size was not big enough. Further external validation in larger populations as well as in Western countries is necessary. In addition, hidden bias may remain even after PSM because of matching only the controls for observed variables (to the extent that they are perfectly measured).In conclusion, our data demonstrated that none of the six SNPs of IL28B had any relationship with SVR in GT2 patients, irrespective of the overall number of patients, or in those with or without RVR."
