"Study population
A total of 584 individuals coinfected with HCV genotype 1 and HIV have started BOC or TVR-based therapy at the participating institutions. Of these, 159 patients had reached week 60 of follow-up at the time of analysis (April 2014) and, thus, fullfilled the inclusion criteria for this study: 46 patients received triple therapy based on BOC and 113 individuals were treated with TVR and Peg-INF/RBV. TVR was administered as a bid regimen in ten (8.8%) of these 113 patients. The median (Q1-Q3) age was 48 (42.8–51) years, 127 (79.9%) were male and 45 (34.4%) were treatment-naïve. Assessment of liver fibrosis prior to therapy was available in 133 subjects. Of these, 63 (47.4%) were cirrhotic. The main baseline characteristics of the two groups are shown in Table 1. Five (10.9%) patients received BOC without a lead-in phase and three (2.7%) of those treated with TVR had a four-week lead-in phase prior to TVR initiation. ART was administered in all but one patient (99.4%) and, in the majority of cases, consisted of a combination of tenofovir plus emtricitabine [119 individuals (74.8%)] or abacavir plus lamivudine [20 individuals (12.6%)], along with raltegravir [81 patients (50.9%)] or ritonavir-boosted atazanavir [44 individuals, 27.7%)]. Data on HCV RNA at TW8 was available in 84 patients. 10.1371/journal.pone.0125080.t001

The median (Q1-Q3) HCV RNA decline was 1.63 (0.68–2.93) log10 IU/mL after lead-in and 5 (11.4%) subjects had an undetectable HCV-RNA at this time point. A total of 51/159 patients discontinued therapy before reaching the scheduled EOT. Among those who received BOC or TVR, respectively, the numbers were: 5 (10.7%) and 17 (12.8%) met futility rules; 4 (8.7%) and 9 (8%) discontinued due to adverse events; 3 (6.5%) and 8 (7.1%) experienced VB; 1 (2.2%) and 4 (3.5%) voluntary dropped out and 2 (4.3%) and 6 (5.3%) relapsed. A total of 100 patients achieved SVR12, accounting for 62.9% (95% CI: 54.9%-70.4%) treatment success in an intention-to-treat approach (missing = failure): 31/46 (67.4%; 95% CI: 52%-80.5%) of the subjects treated with BOC and 69/113 (61.1%; 95% CI: 51.4%-70.1%) of those treated with TVR. The numbers of patients with an undetectable HCV RNA were 60 (56·6%) at TW4, 60 (69%) at TW8, 114 (71·7%) at TW12 and 112 (70.4%) at TW24, respectively, and 108 (67.9%) patients had an undetectable HCV RNA at the scheduled EOT. The proportions of patients with undetectable HCV RNA at the different treatment points according to the treatment regimen are depicted in Fig 1. 10.1371/journal.pone.0125080.g001

Treatment was discontinued due to AEs in 13/159 (8.2%; 95% CI: 4.4%-13.6%) subjects. Any AE were reported in 38/46 (82.6%) of the patients treated with BOC and 92/113 (81·4%) of those treated with TVR. Grade 3 or 4 anemia was reported in 9 (7%) patients, grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia was observed in 22 (17.2%) patients and 21 (16.4%) individuals presented grade 3 or 4 neutropenia. Erythropoietin was administered in 36 (22.6%) individuals and nine (5.7%) received blood transfusion. General dose reductions of Peg-IFN and RBV were reported in 16 (17.4%) and 40 (43.5%) patients of the 92 subjects respectively in whom these data were available. Table 2 summarizes detailed hematological abnormalities observed in the subgroups receiving BOC- or TVR-based therapy. Four (2.5%) individuals developed hepatic decompensation: two (4.3%) individuals treated with BOC and two (1.8%) treated with TVR. One of these patients died due to hepatic failure at TW24 on triple therapy with BOC. Two treatment discontinuations due to AEs to BOC-based therapy were due to severe hematological abnormalities and one due to development of ascites. The AEs leading to early treatment discontinuation in those who received TVR-based therapy were: hematological abnormalities (three patients), depression (three patients), hepatic encephalopathy (one patient), gastrointestinal bleeding and severe skin rash (one patient). Discontinuations due to AEs was observed in 6/73 (8.2%) of those with cirrhosis at baseline versus 7/60 (11.7%) of those without (p = 0.505). Likewise, discontinuations due to AEs was observed in 4 (3.7%) out of 109 patients with a platelet count ≥100 cells/μL versus seven (25%) of the 28 subjects with a platelet count of <100 cells/μL (p<0.001) and in 7/50 (14%) versus 2/6 (33%) of those with baseline albumin values above or below 3.5 g/L (p = 0.223), respectively.

The analysis of predictive factors for treatment success was carried out with regard to SVR12 in an on-treatment approach. A total of 24/36 (66.7%) patients who received ritonavir-boosted atazanavir and 53/74 (71.6%) individuals who received raltegravir achieved SVR12 (p = 0.821). The rates of SVR12 (n/N patients) according to HCV subtype 1a and 1b were 71.8% (56/78) versus 70% (28/40) (p = 0.839). Seventy-four (71.8%) out of 103 subjects with a platelet count of ≥100 cells/μL at baseline versus 11 (57.9%) of 19 patients with <100 cells/μL at baseline achieved SVR12 (p = 0.224). All four patients who had plasma albumin levels below 3.5 g/L versus 26/42 (61.9%) of those with baseline albumin values higher than 3.5 g/L achieved SVR12 (p = 0.126). The relationship between other possible predictors and SVR12 is shown in Table 3. In the multivariate analysis, previous response to dual therapy and lower baseline HCV RNA levels were independently associated with SVR12 (Table 3). Among those patients who achieved undetectable HCV RNA four weeks after HCV PI initiation, 97 (86.6%) achieved SVR12 versus 16 (36.4%) of those who had detectable viral load at week four (p<0.001). The PPV to predict SVR12 in patients achieving undetectable HCV RNA at week four was 85·5% (95% CI: 75.2%-92.2%) while the NPV was 49.2% (95% CI: 36.1%-62.4). 10.1371/journal.pone.0125080.t003

¶as referred to dual therapy with peg-IFN plus RBV. The results of this study show that the efficacy of triple therapy including BOC or TVR in combination with peg-IFN/RBV plus RBV in patients coinfected with HIV and HCV genotype 1 under real life conditions is comparable to that observed in clinical trials, both in HCV-monoinfected [4–7] and in HIV/HCV-coinfected [8,9] subjects. The described response rates are very well in line with the new guidelines of the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) [13] which no longer separate between HIV/HCV and HCV monoinfected patients with regard to indication and choice of therapy, other than drug-drug interactions, due to similar cure rates in the two populations. In addition, these therapies are tolerable for most patients; indeed, the number of discontinuations due to AEs is slightly lower than that previously reported for dual therapy with Peg-IFN plus RBV [28,29].A number of studies have evaluated the efficacy of first-generation PIs [16–19], however, data are derived from different populations and are thus not comparable since they differ in the proportion of patients with advanced liver damage, ethiology and social background that may impact on the adherence. The CUPIC study (compassionate use of BOC and TVR in France) reported SVR12 rates of 42.9% and 51.8%, respectively, in a treatment-experienced, cirrhotic population [16]. Furthermore preliminary results obtained from the expanded access study HEP3002 suggest that the efficacy of TVR in patients with advanced fibrosis treated in the clinical practice is comparable to that observed in clinical trials [17]. Importantly, and in contrast to the present study, these data were obtained from HIV (-) patients. Data on the use of HCV PIs in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients in clinical practice are scarce and mainly available for TVR-based triple therapy [30,31]. The present study includes a large number of HIV/HCV-coinfected patients derived from various centers throughout Europe. Most were treated with TVR, of whom 61% achieved SVR12 in an intention-to-treat analysis. This is a somewhat lower response when compared to phase II clinical trials conducted in treatment-naïve HIV/HCV-coinfected patients, with a low frequency of cirrhosis [9,15]. This is not surprising, since this study includes a higher proportion of difficult-to-treat subjects; specifically individuals bearing advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis and previous non-responders to dual therapy. These findings are, however, consistent with interim and SVR12 data reported from studies conducted in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients [30–32]. With regards to those who received BOC-based triple therapy in the present study, a SVR12 rate of 67% was observed. It is likely that the high number of previously naïve patients and relapsers included herein accounts for this comparably high response rate.The rates of discontinuations due to AEs were 8% in the present study and thus somewhat lower than those reported in clinical trials [8,9,14,15] and even lower than that observed with dual therapy with historical Peg-IFN/RBV in some of the centers participating in the study [28,29]. This probably represents increased tolerability of medication associated side-effects in patients accessing new therapy. In this context, rates of discontinuations due to AEs have improved over time when compared within the same cohorts [28,29]. AEs, predominantly flu-like symptoms, were reported in the majority of the patients. Despite the high proportion of cirrhotic patients, only four individuals developed hepatic decompensations and the rate of discontinuations due to AEs was not influenced by baseline cirrhosis. On the other hand, and in accordance with previously reported data from the CUPIC study [16], baseline platelet count and albumin levels have an impact on the likelihood of discontinuations due to AEs. These observations suggest that although AEs are frequently observed, they are manageable, and that discontinuations rates due to AEs are not higher to what was observed with dual therapy. On the other hand our population was also highly motived as they were waiting for the first generation PI since a long time and hence they were struggling hard not to stop therapy before week 48.The present analysis shows that treatment response four weeks after initiation of the HCV PI has a high PPV for SVR12 in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients, in real life conditions, including previous non-responders and cirrhotic patients. The role of response in the first weeks of BOC- or TVR- based therapy as predictor of treatment response had been previously described in HCV-monoinfected patients with cirrhosis [33]. In fact, response-guided therapy in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients can be applied in TVR-based therapy in previous relapsers or treatment-naïve patients without cirrhosis [24,25]. Likewise, the role of response-guided therapy in BOC-based regimens is currently being evaluated in HIV/HCV co-infected patients [34,35]. Our results suggests that response-guided shortening of therapy duration should be evaluated not only in naïve or relapsing patients, but might be also appropriate in harder-to-cure subjects.Previous relapsers showed highest SVR12 rates when compared to treatment-naïve subjects and previous null or partial responders, while the latter show the poorest response to therapy. This is in accordance with data obtained from clinical trials conducted in HCV-monoinfected and HIV/HCV-coinfected patients [5,7], as well as the UNITE trial [10]. On the other hand, a diagnosis of cirrhosis did not significantly influence the achievement of SVR12. The reason for this finding could be that in most patients cirrhosis diagnosis was based on liver stiffness measurement or biopsy, both allowing an earlier diagnosis than clinical or biological data [36]. Late-stage cirrhosis usually affects treatment outcome. However, in this study subjects were treated with ITF-based combinations. Consequently, the vast majority of the cirrhotic patients presented compensated cirrhosis and, in this setting, the impact on SVR could be less obvious. Nevertheless, there was a difference of 9 percent-points between subjects who presented F0-F3 versus those with F4 at baseline. It is therefore likely that a higher sample size would have led to a statistically significant impact of cirrhosis on treatment outcome. However, for patients with biological abnormalities consistent with advanced cirrhosis and portal hypertension, such as hypoalbuminemia or thrombocytopenia, the rate of adverse effects was higher.The present work has a certain limitations. The clinical impact of this work might diminish since next generation DAAs show improved efficacy over TVR or BOC, show better tolerability, a lower potential of DDIs and are easier to administer [37,38]. However, these regimens may not be widely used in the next years, because of financial constraints even in developed countries. Therefore, triple therapy including BOC or TVR may well remain of importance in the near future. Additionally, this study represents an important historic reference to evaluate the evolution of SVR rates to different regimens over time under real-life condition in the coinfected population.In conclusion, the efficacy and safety of triple therapy including BOC or TVR in combination with Peg-IFN plus RBV in routine clinical practice in a HIV/HCV-coinfected population was acceptable and comparable to what is observed in clinical trials. Drug-related toxicity can be managed and AEs do not lead to discontinuations in the majority of the patients."
