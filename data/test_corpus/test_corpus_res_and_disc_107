Among 70 patients, 61 (87.1%, 61/70) of them were infected with HCV genotype 1b and 6 (8.6%, 6/70) patients were infected with HCV genotype 2a. The HCV genotype data were missing in 3 (4.3%, 3/70) patients. Treatment Responses
As 4 cases who didn’t provide requested information at 12 weeks after treatment were missing, 66 subjects were included in the efficacy analysis for cEVR assessment (34 patients treated with IFNα-2b/RBV and 32 cases with PegIFNα-2a/RBV). Among 34 patients treated with IFNα-2b/RBV, 25 (73.5%, 25/34) achieved cEVR, and 25 (78.1%, 25/32) underwent PegIFNα-2a/RBV treatment achieved cEVR. There was no significant difference in the cEVR incidences between the two groups (P = 0.663).
We evaluated the potential relationship between HCV genotypes and early response patterns (cEVR or non-cEVR). Among 66 subjects included in the efficacy analysis for cEVR assessment (60 patients infected with HCV genotype 1b and 6 cases with HCV genotype 2a), 45 (75.0%, 45/60) patients with HCV genotype 1b infection achieved cEVR, while 5 (83.3%, 5/6) patients infected with HCV genotype 2a achieved cEVR. Tregs and Virological Response
The effect of different types of interferon combined with RBV on peripheral CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ Tregs proportion in CD4+ T-cells was assessed. The Tregs frequency was higher in chronic hepatitis C patients than that in the controls (P = 0.031) (Fig. 2), which was significantly decreased at 12 weeks after treatment with IFNα-2b/RBV (P = 0.015) (Fig. 3A) or PegIFNα-2a/RBV (P = 0.034) (Fig. 3B). No further change was observed at 24 weeks compared with 12 weeks following treatment. With respect to the Tregs levels, no significant difference was observed between IFNα-2b/RBV and PegIFNα-2a/RBV groups in any time point (P>0.05). A representative flow cytometry dot plot of Tregs proportion in CD4+ T-cells was shown in Fig. 4A and 4B.

As compared with the baselines, the Tregs frequency was significantly decreased at 12, 24 weeks in cEVR patients (P<0.001) and at 24 weeks in non-cEVR cases (P = 0.001 and P = 0.015, respectively) after treatment with IFNα-2b/RBV or PegIFNα-2a/RBV (Fig. 5A and 5B). Futhermore, Tregs frequency was significantly lower in cEVR patients than that in non-cEVR cases after 12 weeks of medication (P<0.001 and P = 0.015, respectively) (Fig. 5C and 5D), whereas no significant difference in the proportion was found at baseline and 24 weeks after therapy (Fig. 5C and 5D).

PD-1 expression on T-cell subsets was determined by the percentage of PD-1 positive cells. The PD-1 expressing CD4+ T-cells (P = 0.012) or CD8+ T-cells (P = 0.004) were significantly higher in chronic hepatitis C patients than those in healthy controls at baseline (Fig. 2). Compared with its baseline level, PD-1 expressing CD8+ T-cells was decreased after 12 weeks of therapy in patients received IFNα-2b/RBV (P = 0.035) or PegIFNα-2a/RBV (P = 0.015), and further reduced at 24 weeks after treatment compared with its 12 weeks level (P = 0.034 and P = 0.029, respectively) (Fig. 3A and 3B). However, the PD-1 expressing CD4+ T-cells did not show significant change after antiviral treatment. In addition, there was no significant difference of the PD-1 expressing CD4+ T-cells or CD8+ T-cells between IFNα-2b/RBV and PegIFNα-2a/RBV groups in any parallel time point (P>0.05). A representative flow cytometry dot plot of PD-1 expressing CD4+ or CD8+ T-cells was shown in Fig. 6A and 6B.

CD4+ or CD8+ lymphocytes were gated by positive staining of CD4 or CD8 and SSC. The percentage of positive cells is indicated in the upper right region. By analyzing the relationship between PD-1 level and virological response, compared with the baseline levels, PD-1 expressing CD4+ T-cells were markedly decreased after 12 weeks of therapy with IFNα-2b/RBV (P = 0.004) or PegIFNα-2a/RBV (P<0.001) in cEVR patients, but it did not show significant change in non-cEVR cases (Fig. 5A and 5B). As respect to PD-1 expressing CD8+ T-cells, we found that it’s frequency was significantly decreased at 12, 24 weeks in cEVR patients (P<0.001) and at 24 weeks in non-cEVR cases (P = 0.009 and P = 0.006, respectively) after treatment with IFNα-2b/RBV or PegIFNα-2a/RBV (Fig. 5A and 5B). Compared with non-cEVR patients, frequencies of PD-1 expressing CD4+ (P = 0.005 and P = 0.002, respectively) in two treatment groups and PD-1 expressing CD8+ T-cells (P = 0.001) in IFNα-2b/RBV treated group were significantly lower in patients who achieved cEVR after 12 weeks of therapy (Fig. 5C and 5D), though no differences were seen at baseline and 24 weeks after treatment (Fig. 5C and 5D). TLR3 Expressing CD14+ Monocytes and Virological Response
TLR3 expressing CD14+ monocytes, determined by the percentage of TLR3 positive cells, were higher in chronic hepatitis C patients than those in healthy controls (P<0.001) (Fig. 2), and further increased after 12 weeks of treatment (P = 0.033 and P = 0.018, respectively), but returned to baseline level at 24 weeks in the two treatment groups (Fig. 3A and 3B). No significant difference was presented in TLR3 expressing CD14+ monocytes between IFNα-2b/RBV and PegIFNα-2a/RBV groups in any parallel time point (P>0.05). A representative flow cytometry dot plot of TLR3 expressing CD14+ monocytes was shown in Fig. 7A and 7B.

Cells were stained with monoclonal antibodies to CD14 and TLR3. The percentage of positive cells is indicated in the upper right region. TLR3 expressing CD14+ monocytes were significantly increased after 12 weeks of treatment (P<0.001), and restored close to the baseline levels at 24 weeks in cEVR patients of the two treatment groups, but this changes were not significant in non-cEVR cases (Fig. 5A and 5B). Notably, the baseline TLR3 expressing CD14+ monocytes were significantly lower in patients achieved cEVR than those with non-cEVR (P = 0.009 and P = 0.011, respectively) (Fig. 5C and 5D), whereas there was no relationship between TLR3 expressing CD14+ monocytes and virological response at 12 and 24 weeks after treatment in the two groups (Fig. 5C and 5D). Predict Factors of Treatment Response
Variables that may be related to treatment response were assessed by multivariate logistic regression analysis, including baseline laboratory parameters, consisting of Tregs, PD-1expressing CD4+ T-cells or CD8+ T-cells, TLR3 expressing CD14+ monocytes, serum viral load, ALT and AST, as well as the use of interferon types. It was found that low proportion of baseline TLR3 expressing CD14+ monocytes was a single predictor of cEVR in chronic hepatitis C patients with antiviral treatment [odds ratio (OR)  = 2.11, 95% confidence intervals (CI) (1.15–3.88), P = 0.023]. Lack of Association of Tregs, PD-1 and TLR3 with HCV Genotype, Viral Load, ALT and AST
Relationships of the baseline levels and the dynamic changes during treatment of Tregs, PD-1 expressing CD4+ T-cells or CD8+ T-cells and TLR3 expressing CD14+ monocytes with HCV genotypes were analyzed. No difference was found between HCV genotype 1b and 2a infected patients at each time point (data not shown). Moreover, there was no correlation of Tregs, PD-1 expressing CD4+ T-cells or CD8+ T-cells and TLR3 expressing CD14+ monocytes with baseline HCV load, ALT and AST levels as well (data not shown).
Patients who achieved cEVR have the best chance of achieving SVR [19], [20]. In our study, the cEVR rates were 73.5% and 78.1% in patients treated with IFNα-2b/RBV and PegIFNα-2a/RBV, respectively. The results were better than others reported on the early pivotal clinical trials, in which only 50%–66% patients infected with HCV achieved cEVR [21]–[23]. The reasons for this disparity might arise from host IL-28B genetic variation (rs12979860 CC genotype) [24] and low body weight in Chinese population which were associated with interferon sensitivity and treatment-induced viral clearance.A favorable treatment response includes a strong cellular immune response against HCV antigens [25], [26]. To seek the role of cellular immune response in chronic hepatitis C patients with antiviral treatment, we investigated the dynamic changes of peripheral Tregs, PD-1 expressing T-cells and TLR3 expressing CD14+ monocytes in the patients. In the present study, proportions of Tregs and PD-1 expressing CD4+ T-cells or CD8+ T-cells were significantly increased in the patients at baseline as compared with the controls, indicating that the impaired cellular immune function might contribute to chronic HCV infection. It was reported that HCV infection had a high propensity to develop persistent viremia and was associated with ineffective viral-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells responses [27], [28]. The cause of T-cells failure might relate to up-regulation of CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ Tregs [6] and PD-1 expressions [11], [13], [29]–[32] which inhibited HCV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells function.Feld et al. [33] has suggested that the immune-modulatory activity of interferon and ribavirin therapy may be associated with enhancing T effector cells response to HCV, thus, the impaired cellular immunity by persistent HCV infection might be partially restored by interferon and ribavirin administration. In our study, there was a significant decrease of Tregs and PD-1 expressing CD8+ T-cells in chronic hepatitis C patients at 12 weeks after treatment compared with their baseline levels, indicating that IFN/RBV treatment could restore HCV-specific T-cells response by reducing circulating CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ Tregs and PD-1 expressing CD8+ T-cells. Furthermore, the decrease proportions of Tregs and PD-1 expressing CD4+ T-cells or CD8+ T-cells were more obvious in cEVR patients than those in non-cEVR cases. According to Thimme et al. [34], [35], T cell exhaustion contributed to the failure of about half of HCV-specific CD8+ T cell responses and the antiviral efficacy of HCV-specific CD8+ T cells was linked to surface expression of PD-1. Other studies had also reported that PD-1 was up-regulated on total CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in patients with chronic infection compared with normal subjects, and antiviral therapy that led to sustained elimination of circulating HCV RNA was associated with down-regulation of PD-1 on a wide range of cells [36], [37]. Besides PD-1 modulation, activation of Tregs also involved in impairment of HCV-specific T effector cells. Langhans’s study proposed that antiviral therapy is likely to shift the functional balance in the immune system between Tregs and T effector cells towards more efficacious effector responses in chronic hepatitis C patients. Our finding was in accordance with Langhans report [38], which indicated that interferon combined with ribavirin therapy could enhance proliferation of T effector cells as well as inhibit functions of Tregs, thus, reverses Treg-mediated suppression of T effector cells in chronic hepatitis C.Treatment with IFNα-2b/RBV or PegIFNα-2a/RBV for 12 weeks, the frequencies of circulating Tregs and PD-1 expressing CD4+ in two groups or PD-1 expressing CD8+ T-cells in IFNα-2b/RBV group in patients who achieved cEVR were significantly lower than those in patients without cEVR. For PegIFNα-2a/RBV treated group, the frequencies of PD-1 expressing CD8+ was also lower in cEVR patients, but the P value was higher than 0.0167, perhaps on account of small sample size. Therefore, we speculated that Tregs and PD-1 could inhibit the responder cells population and function, which correlated with the risk of developing non-response. In contrast, patients who showed relatively abrogated capacity of Tregs and PD-1 might achieve cEVR and recover from HCV infection. This demonstrated that the suppression of Tregs and PD-1 might correlate with cEVR as it could generate an effective immune response and which provide a possible therapeutic target for immune modulation. However, whether the decrease in the frequency of Tregs and PD-1 expressing CD4+ or CD8+ T-cells were the necessary causes of cEVR warranted further investigation. No significant differences of the Tregs and PD-1 expressing CD4+ T-cells or CD8+ T-cells were found between IFNα-2b/RBV and PegIFNα-2a/RBV treated groups at any parallel time either from cEVR or non-cEVR, indicating that the immunomodulatory effects of IFNα-2b and PegIFNα-2a were comparable.Activation of TLRs can induce both innate and adaptive immunity [39]. TLR3 signaling is induced by double-stranded (ds) RNA, a molecular signature of viruses, and is mediated by the TIR domain-containing adaptor-inducing IFN-β (TRIF) adaptor molecule. Thus, TLR3 plays an important role in the host response to viral infections [40]. The innate immune response activated through recognition of viral PAMPs by TLR3 leads to IFN-β induction, which in turn increases the interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) expression. Thus far, TLR3 expression in peripheral blood has not been well analyzed in chronic hepatitis C patients under antiviral treatment. Monocytes in peripheral blood were identified as the cells responding to TLRs stimulation [41]. In present study, we found that the level of TLR3 expressing CD14+ monocytes was elevated in chronic hepatitis C patients and further increased at 12 weeks, but returned to baseline level at 24 weeks after treatment with IFNα-2b/RBV or PegIFNα-2a/RBV. This change was more significant in cEVR patients than that in non-cEVR ones. This suggested that the anti-HCV treatment could increase TLR3 expressing CD14+ monocytes to enhance antiviral activity at early stage of treatment and restore the cell number and function to baseline level as HCV was cleared. An important finding coming from our TLR3 analysis was that lower peripheral TLR3 expressing CD14+ monocytes at baseline was an independent predictor for cEVR. In keeping with our findings, Hashad et al. [22] and Yuki et al. [23] found that pretreatment up-regulation of hepatic TLR3 expression was a predictive factor for non-respond. HCV infection could activate monocytes via TLRs pathway and elevate the expression of TLR3 as our study found, but pre-existing monocytes activation was a factor mediating reduced responses to TLR3 stimulation [42]. Thus, infection of monocytes by HCV may account for a defective response to HCV infection. Furthermore, the endogenous IFN system activation in the liver before treatment not only was ineffective in HCV clearance but also hampered further response to exogenous IFN plus RBV [37]. These reasons might explain why the level of TLR3 expressing CD14+ monocytes was lower in cEVR patients than that in non-cEVR ones, but further and expanded investigations were needed to clarify the underlying mechanisms. Therefore, the baseline level of peripheral TLR3 expressing CD14+ monocytes might serve as a predictor of response to antiviral therapy and have a substantial impact on treatment decision-making."
