"Levels of IFNAR-1 in PBMC from naive HCV-infected patients carrying different IL-28B rs12979860 genotypes, and in vitro response to IFN-alpha
To assess the relationships between the expression of IFNAR-1 mRNA and the IL-28B rs12979860 genotypes, mRNA levels of IFNAR-1 were tested at baseline and after 3 h of exposure to either control medium or IFN-alpha (103 IU/ml) in PBMC obtained from naive HCV-infected patients carrying different IL-28B rs12979860 genotypes. Patients carrying CC genotype showed IFNAR-1 mRNA median basal levels significantly higher than patients with CT/TT genotype: 1.420 (IQR: 0.875–1.655) vs 0.629 (IQR: 0.504–1.005); p = 0.0142; in addition, significantly higher levels in CC vs CT/TT genotypes was observed after exposure to IFN-alpha [median: 2.220 (IQR: 0.908–3.647) vs 0.6280 (IQR: 0.395–1.522); p = 0.0149]. More in detail, the most prominent difference was observed between CC and TT groups, both at basal level (Fig. 1, Panel A) [median: 1.420 (IQR: 0.875–1.655) vs 0.629 (IQR: 0.532–0.925); p = 0.0135] and after exposure to IFN-alpha (Fig. 1, Panel B) [median: 2.220 (IQR: 0.908–3.647) vs 0.461 (IQR: 0.353–1.048); p = 0.0373], while between CC and CT groups a borderline significant difference was observed both at basal level (Fig. 1, Panel A) [median: 1.420 (IQR: 0.875–1.655) vs 0.676 (IQR: 0.468–1.137); p = 0.0500] and after exposure to IFN-alpha (Fig. 1, Panel B) [median values: 2.220 (IQR: 0.908–3.647) vs 0.840 (IQR: 0.397–1.599); p = 0.0500]. IFN-alpha treatment did not significantly affect the levels of IFNAR-1 mRNA in all genotypes (CC, untreated vs IFN-treated, median: 1.420 (IQR: 0.875–1.655) vs 2.034 (IQR: 0.808–2.888); p = 0.3510; CT, untreated vs IFN-treated CT, median: 0.6760 (IQR: 0.468–1.137) vs 1.046 (IQR: 0.411–1.639); p = 0.5510; TT, untreated vs IFN-treated, median: 0.6290 (IQR: 0.532–0.965) vs 0.461 (IQR: 0.353–1.048); p = 0.5240).

IFNAR-1 mRNA levels before and after treatment with IFN-alpha in PBMC from naive HCV-infected patients.
Total cellular RNA was extracted and reverse-transcribed from PBMC of naive HCV-infected patients carrying different IL-28B rs12979869 genotypes CC, TT and CT before (Panel A) and after 3 h of exposure to 103 IU/ml IFN-alpha (Panel B), then mRNA levels for IFNAR-1 were measured. Results are expressed as ratio to beta-actin (median, IQR). Basal levels of IFN-lambda was also investigated, and no differences were appreciated between the different IL-28B genotypes, at both PBMC mRNA and plasma protein level (data not shown). However, a significant correlation between mRNA levels of IFN-lambda and IFNAR-1 was observed in CC carriers (r = 0.6881, p = 0.0433). Role of IFN-lambda on IFNAR-1 mRNA expression in PBMC from healthy donors carrying different IL-28B rs12979860 genotypes
To evaluate the possible role of IFN-lambda on IFNAR-1 mRNA expression, PBMC from 6 healthy donors carrying different IL-28B genotypes (3 rs12979860 CC, and 3 rs12979860 TT) were exposed either to 10 or 100 ng/ml of human recombinant IL-28/IFN-lambda2, and levels of IFNAR-1 mRNA were measured at different time points. The basal levels of IFNAR-1 mRNA in healthy donors were significantly higher than those observed in HCV patients [median: 6.516 (IQR: 4.888–7.556) vs 0.732 (IQR: 0.393–1.829); p = 0.0004], and seemed to be independent from IL-28B genotype. The dose dependent response after 3 h exposure to IFN-lambda is shown in Fig. 2, were up-regulation of IFNAR-1 mRNA was observed in both genotypes, being 10 ng/ml the most effective dose. More interestingly, the IFN-lambda-driven stimulation was more pronounced in subjects carrying the CC genotype at both doses.

Dose dependent induction of IFNAR-1 mRNA levels following treatment with IFN-lambda in PBMC from healthy donors.
PBMC from 6 healthy donors with different IL-28B rs12979860 genotypes (3 CC •; 3 TT ○) were exposed for 3 h to either control medium or IFN-lambda (10 ng/ml, 100 ng/ml), then mRNA levels for IFNAR-1 were measured. Results are expressed as ratio to beta-actin (mean ± SE). In Fig. 3 time-and dose-dependent response from two representative subjects (CC and TT) is shown, confirming 10 ng/ml of IFN-lambda as optimal dose, and showing, again, a better stimulation in CC genotype. In particular, at 10 ng/ml peak stimulation in CC genotype occurred earlier (12 h) and was more extensive than in TT genotype (24 h).

PBMC were exposed to control medium (▪) 10 ng/mL (▪) and 100 ng/mL (□) of IFN-lambda, then mRNA levels for IFNAR-1 were measured at different time points (0, 3, 6, 12 and 24 h). Results are expressed as ratio to beta-actin. Results from one representative experiment performed on PBMC from two healthy donors with IL-28B rs12979860 CC (Panel A) and TT (Panel B) genotype are shown.
Since 2009, several studies have shown that there is an important association between IL-28B polymorphisms and the outcome of standard anti-HCV therapy [9], [11]. Among the identified SNPs, rs12979860 appeared the most relevant, being associated with both therapy-induced and spontaneous clearance of HCV. Data so far available indicate that the rs12979860-favorable (CC) genotype is associated with higher expression of IFN-lambda [12], [13] that, in turn, may contribute to viral clearance. This hypothesis is further supported by the evidence that high IFN-lambda peak serum levels during the acute phase are associated with a self-limited course of HCV infection [18]. However, the association between elevated IFN-lambda expression and HCV clearance is not unequivocally reported, since other studies have shown higher levels of IFN-lambda in the liver of patients with the hapless genotype [28]. Inappropriate IFN-lambda activation (altered level, potency or timing) upon HCV infection may explain the apparent contradiction between the two opposite lines of evidence [29]. Based on these evidences and considering a previous study in which our group observed a reduced expression of IFNAR-1 mRNA in poorly performing patients [25], we explored the possible relationships between IL-28 rs12979860 genotype and the expression of IFNAR-1 in naive HCV patients.Our results highlighted a significant difference of IFNAR-1 mRNA expression in PBMC from patients carrying rs12979860 CC and CT/TT genotypes, with the most prominent difference in the absence of -C allele. It is to be underlined that the IFN-alpha treatment did not significantly affect the levels of IFNAR-1 mRNA, suggesting a marginal role of this cytokine in the observed differences. A significant correlation between endogenous levels of circulating IFN-lambda and spontaneous levels of IFNAR-1 mRNA in PBMC was observed in patients carrying CC genotype, although no differences of IFN-lambda levels could be appreciated between the different genotypes. The lack of detectable difference is probably due to the chronic infection state of our patients, where the reduced levels of circulating IFN-lambda might have hampered the comparison. This is in line with other groups that described lower levels of circulating IFN-lambda in HCV chronically infected patients as compared to spontaneously resolved infections [18], [27]. We then explored whether IFN-lambda could be able to up-regulate IFNAR-1 expression in normal PBMC. As compared to HCV patients, the basal levels of IFNAR-1 mRNA in healthy donors appeared significantly higher, and seemed independent from IL-28 genotype. On the contrary, the IL-28 genotype was important in the IFN-lambda response, since a stimulation was observed in a time-and dose-dependent manner, and was much more pronounced in CC vs TT carriers.Our findings suggest that IFN-lambda could play a crucial role in the modulation of IFNAR-1 expression, and that endogenous levels of IL-28B may be responsible for partial restoration of IFNAR-1 expression in HCV patients with favourable IL-28B genotypes. A number of published studies, show that the mRNA levels of IFNAR-1 are correlated with the extent of IFN response both in vivo and in vitro [30], [31], [32]. Therefore, although the present study does not provide direct demonstration that the different IFNAR-1 mRNA levels translate into different expression of IFNAR at cell surface, it is tempting to speculate that this partial restoration may confer to CC carriers a response advantage to either endogenous or exogenous IFN-alpha, representing the biological basis for the observed association between CC genotype and favourable outcome of either natural infection (clearance vs chronicization) or IFN therapy.In summary, although the findings from the present study are preliminary, since they derive from a limited number of patients and might benefit from larger studies, they provide novel information, contributing to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the strong predictive value of IL-28B polymorphisms on the natural history and on the response to IFN therapy in HCV infection."
