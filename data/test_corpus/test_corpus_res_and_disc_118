"Patient Disposition and Baseline Characteristics
A total of 56 patients were randomized, of whom 54 were treated between August 8, 2008 and July 27, 2009 (45 BMS-936558, 9 placebo). Patient disposition is shown in Figure 1. All treated subjects in the ITT-exposed population completed the Day 29 evaluations. One patient assigned to placebo withdrew consent at Day 31 and discontinued the study. No patient discontinued due to an adverse event.
10.1371/journal.pone.0063818.g001Figure 1
Patient disposition. There were no clinically relevant differences between dose groups in baseline disease or demographic parameters (Table 1). Most patients were white males with 57% (31/54) HCV genotype 1a infections overall; treatment-naïve patients were somewhat younger than other treatment groups. Ten subjects who received 10 mg/kg of BMS-936558 and 2 placebo subjects were treatment-naive. Among treatment-experienced patients, approximately 38% (16/42) had prior null response to peginterferon-alfa/ribavirin therapy, 12% (5/42) had partial response, 36% (15/42) had post-treatment relapse, and 14% (6/42) had received incomplete or inadequate therapy.

In the ITT-exposed population, clinical response (HCV RNA decline ≥0.5 log10 IU/mL on at least two consecutive visits) was observed in six patients: one of five (20%) treatment-experienced patients who received BMS-936558 0.1 mg/kg, one of 10 (10%) in the treatment-experienced group receiving BMS-936558 10 mg/kg, three of 10 (30%) in the treatment-naïve group receiving BMS-936558 10 mg/kg, and one of nine (11%) placebo recipients (Table 2). The duration of response was ≥8 weeks for four of the six responders and between 4 and 8 weeks in two.

Among the six clinical responders, three patients receiving BMS-936558 10 mg/kg – two treatment-naïve and one prior null responder – experienced reductions in serum HCV RNA that exceeded 4 log10 IU/mL at nadir (Figure 2 and Table 2). Of these three, one IL28B-CC homozygous, treatment-naive patient with HCV GT-1a from a pre-study genotype assay (patient 1; Fig. 2A) experienced a 4.55 log10 decline in HCV RNA which subsequently began to return to pre-treatment levels on-study. One prior null responder with HCV genotype 1a from pre-study assay data showed HCV RNA that dropped below the assay lower limit of quantitation at study Day 85 (Patient 2; Fig. 2B), subsequently became undetectable, and remained undetectable for more than 1 year after study completion. This patient was an IL28B-TT homozygote, consistent with prior non-response to interferon-alfa treatment [42], [43]. Finally, one treatment-naïve, IL28B-CC patient demonstrated HCV RNA below the assay lower limit of quantitation at Study days 57 through 85 (patient 3; Fig. 2C). In post-study follow up this patient became transiently undetectable before HCV RNA returned to pretreatment levels. This patient was infected with HCV genotype 1 but his subtype could not be established. In addition, in this latter patient, population genotypic analysis of the NS5A region from baseline and relapse samples confirmed that re-infection had not occurred (data not shown). All three patients were male, and all received BMS-936558 in July 2009. There were no other homogeneous factors or features among them.

HCV RNA and ALT changes in patients with clinical response. Immunologic Outcomes
No clinically relevant changes in immunoglobulin subsets (IgM, IgA, IgG) were observed. Mean changes from baseline were <15% in both BMS-936558 and placebo groups for all three subsets during follow-up.
The immunoadjuvant activity of BMS-936558 on antibody titers to tetanus toxoid was explored. Anti-tetanus antibody levels varied between patients but median levels were generally comparable for those who received study drug (any dose) versus placebo. Some patients in the placebo group showed transient increases in tetanus titers at Day 8, while subjects at dose levels of 0.03 through 1 mg/kg showed only minimal changes throughout the study. In contrast, greater than 5-fold increases in anti-tetanus antibody titer over pre-treatment baseline were seen at Day 8 in two patients who received 3.0 mg/kg BMS-936558 (9-fold and 11-fold over baseline) and in four treatment-experienced patients who received 10 mg/kg (6-fold to 36-fold over baseline). These increases subsequently declined back towards baseline (Figure 3).

Mean changes from baseline in anti-tetanus antibody titer. In quantitative type IV hypersensitivity skin tests, there were no treatment-related patterns in Candida-specific or tetanus-specific erythema or induration.
Four patients had positive responses in BMS-936558 immunogenicity assessments (human-anti-human antibody [HAHA] analysis) conducted pretreatment, Day 29 and Day 85. One patient was positive pretreatment but negative thereafter, two patients were positive only on Day 85, and one patient was positive on Days 29 and 85. The latter three patients received low doses (0.03 or 0.3 mg/kg) of BMS-936558.
There were no apparent treatment-related trends in mean serum levels of IL-13, IP-10, neopterin, TGF-β1, IFN-γ, IL-10, IL-12, IL-1B, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, or TNF-α during follow-up (data not shown).
Mean absolute values and percentages of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD19+, CD3+/CD4+ (± CD38+, ± HLA-DR+), CD3+/CD8+ (± CD38+, ± HLA-DR+), CD4+/CD25+, CD16+/CD56+, and in the CD4+/CD8+ and CD3+/CD19+ ratios on peripheral blood lymphocytes, were examined by flow cytometry. Treatment was associated with substantial but transient declines at Day 2 in absolute CD4+ and CD8+ cells (both the memory and naïve subsets) and in CD19+ cells (Table 3) that were not dose-related. Substantial changes in cell percentages were not evident (Table 3). Cell counts generally returned to pretreatment levels after one week. PBMCs were obtained for ELISpot analysis of antigen-specific T-cell responses pre- and post-treatment. Unfortunately, cell viability was very low (generally <30% viable cells) and not permissive of ELISpot analysis.

The most common adverse events were fatigue, headache, diarrhea, and pharyngeal pain (Table 4), with no pattern suggesting dose-related differences in frequencies. All events were mild or moderate in intensity (grade 1 or 2) with the exception of one severe (grade 4) ALT elevation in a treatment-naïve patient who received BMS-936558 10 mg/kg. Infection-related adverse events suggested neither treatment-related immune deficits nor exaggerated immune responses during the observation period. The grade 4 ALT elevation occurred in a 51 year-old male diagnosed with hepatitis C in 2006 and naive to prior therapy. ALT was normal at baseline but began increasing two days after dosing with BMS-936558 10 mg/kg (Figure 2A). ALT levels peaked on Day 22 at 17-fold above the upper limit of normal (43 U/L), concurrent with the maximum reduction in HCV RNA (4.55 log10 IU/mL). Other indicators of hepatic function, such as bilirubin levels and INR, remained stable. Serologic evaluation for concurrent liver disease was unrevealing. This event resolved without intervention.

0 Immune-related adverse events, defined as clinically significant events consistent with an immune-mediated mechanism and of otherwise unknown etiology, were identified in six BMS-936558 recipients. These events included one patient who experienced hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, urticaria and pruritus; one patient who experienced hyperthyroidism and diarrhea; two patients with diarrhea alone, and one patient each with blister and rash, respectively. All events were mild to moderate in intensity and resolved without specific intervention. Hypo- and hyperthyroidism were established by assay of TSH, total T3 and free T4.
In addition to the grade 4 ALT elevation previously described, two other potentially immune-related events are of particular note: one case of hyperthyroidism in a patient on concomitant levothyroxine that required medical intervention, and one exacerbation of adult onset diabetes.
The hyperthyroidism event concerned an interferon-alfa-experienced 52 year-old male diagnosed with HCV infection in 1995 and hypothyroidism in 1997, requiring levothyroxine administration prior to study entry. The patient’s baseline TSH (1.96 MIU/L) and total T3 (2.2 nmol/L) were within the normal ranges of 0.34–5.6 MIU/L and 1.2–2.3 nmol/L, respectively. The patient received 1 mg/kg of BMS-936558 and subsequently reported insomnia on Day 5, diarrhea and increased appetite on Day 13, and anxiety on Day 29. Thyroid function tests on Day 29 revealed low TSH (0.14 MIU/L) and mildly elevated total T3 (2.7 nmol/L); the subject was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism and instructed to discontinue levothyroxine. Antithyroglobulin antibody (ATGA) titer was slightly high at pre-treatment baseline (17.0 IU/mL [normal range 0.0–14.4], increased to 264 IU/mL at Day 29, and subsequently increased further to a maximum of 397 IU/mL on Day 57. Symptoms improved; TSH measured 26.28 MIU/L on Day 57 and the patient was restarted on levothyroxine 25µg daily. TSH and ATGA remained elevated through the end of the study and the subject remained on treatment for hypothyroidism.
The exacerbation of diabetes concerned a 45 year old Caucasian male with HCV infection since 2000 and ongoing diabetes treated with metformin, who experienced significant worsening of blood glucose control on study day 22 requiring the introduction of insulin which persisted until study conclusion. Computer-assisted tomography did not reveal a structural cause for the changes and no coincident infection or other precipitating cause of the exacerbation of his diabetes was identified. Anti-insulin antibodies and other markers of autoimmune diabetes were not examined [44]. Pharmacokinetics
BMS-936558 demonstrated dose-related increases in exposure across the range of doses studied, with near dose-proportional increases over the dose range of 1 to 10 mg/kg (Table 5). Specifically, for an increase in dose in the ratio of 1.0∶ 3.0∶ 10, there was an increase in Cmax in a ratio of 1.0∶ 3.0∶ 7.3 and an increase in AUCINF of 1.0∶ 3.4∶ 9.5. Furthermore, BMS-936558 exhibited a long serum half-life (T½), of 20.6 days for the 1 mg/kg cohort, increasing slightly to 23.7 days for the 10 mg/kg cohort. The variability of derived exposure measures Cmax and AUCINF was consistently modest (coefficients of variation between 13% and 20%) at doses from 1 to 10 mg/kg, but higher between 0.03 and 0.3 mg/kg, most likely due to assay limitations for quantifying the low serum levels obtained at the lower doses.

23.7 (4.41) aTwo subjects in the 0.03 mg/kg dose cohort had serum drug concentrations below the assay lower limit of quantitation for all time points and were excluded from pharmacokinetic statistical analyses.NR = Not reported; the AUCINF extrapolated area was >20% of the total area resulting in undue potential for error.These data describe the proof-of-concept evaluation of an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody in patients with chronic viral infection. Following administration of a single dose of BMS-936558, HCV RNA reductions ≥0.5 log10 IU/mL were observed on ≥2 consecutive visits (protocol-defined clinical response) in five of 45 (11.1%) patients. At the highest administered dose (10 mg/kg), HCV RNA reductions >4 log10 IU/mL were observed in three patients. Thus, in this high-dose group, 3/20 patients, or 15%, experienced significant reductions of HCV RNA. Suppression of HCV replication persisted more than eight weeks in most patients, consistent with the hypothesized immunologic mode of action as well as the long serum half-life of BMS-936558 [40]. HCV RNA was below the assay lower limit of quantitation (25 IU/mL) in two patients at the end of the 12-week study follow-up, one of whom, a prior null responder to interferon-alfa, progressed to undetectable HCV RNA and remained so over one year later.HCV RNA generally varies <0.5 log10 IU/mL in patients with established HCV infection and spontaneous remissions are rare [38], [45], therefore it appears that the observed reductions in virus titer are related to treatment with BMS-936558. While conclusions are limited by the small number of patients treated in this study, responders did not have a higher rate of immune-related adverse events and neither BMS-936558 exposure nor immunogenicity predicted response. The modest rate of response may have been due, at least in part, to the administration of only a single dose to establish proof of concept. In addition, several other processes affecting the HCV-specific host immune response may conceivably have contributed to these observations, though data are lacking in this small patient set. For example, response may be influenced by levels of PD-1 ligand expression in the liver or lymphoid organs. The effectiveness of anti-PD-1 blockade could be limited by the emergence of HCV variants with T cell escape mutations conferring reduced immunogenicity and recognition by T cells targeting the original virus. Finally, other cell surface inhibitory receptors in addition to PD-1–such as lymphocyte activation gene-3 (LAG-3), T cell immunoglobulin mucin-3 (TIM-3), and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) – are implicated in the co-regulation of the T cell exhaustion phenotype [46], [47], and their influence may also limit the effectiveness a single-locus blockade of PD-1. It is noteworthy that in ex vivo studies of T-cells from patients with chronic HCV infection, the modest functional impairment of circulating CD8+ T-cells could be reversed by PD-1 blockade alone, whereas the marked dysfunction of intrahepatic CD8+ T-cells, which expressed very high levels of PD-1, could not [33]. However, impairment of both circulating and intrahepatic CD8+ cells in HCV infection could be reversed by simultaneous blockade of both PD-1 and CTLA-4 [38].Several immunologic findings were noteworthy. First, as might be expected from a human monoclonal antibody, human-anti-human (HAHA) antibody responses were not detected in most patients through 85 days post-dose, suggesting such responses did not influence safety or antiviral activity. Second, a transient decrease in CD4+, CD8+ and CD19+ lymphocytes was observed post treatment. These were changes were generally transient and not associated with adverse events suggesting immune deficits. Similar observations have been made in cancer patients following anti-PD-1 administration [21] and were hypothesized to represent redistribution of lymphocyte subsets into tumor and tissue compartments. Finally, the immunoadjuvant activity of BMS-936558 on anti-tetanus toxoid antibody levels was explored. Marked increases in anti-tetanus antibody levels over pre-treatment baseline were seen in several patients who received 3.0 mg/kg BMS-936558 and 10 mg/kg which exceeded changes observed in patients who received lower doses or placebo. A finding of an effect of anti-PD-1 blockade on antibody titers would be consistent with a role for PD-1 in B cell as well as T follicular helper cell function as has been described [48], [49]. Increases in anti-SIV titers have previously been shown in SIV-infected macaques treated with an anti-PD-1 antibody [36].A single dose of BMS-936558 was generally well tolerated; most common adverse events were non-specific in nature. Immune-related adverse events were anticipated with this intervention; such events could result from a break in host tolerance to self-antigens or from a liver-directed antiviral T-cell response following reversal of immune suppression. Overall, immune-related events were infrequent, mostly mild to moderate in intensity, and generally similar to those reported in studies of BMS-936558 in patients with solid tumors [21]. Most immune-related events resolved spontaneously.Endocrine abnormalities, including thyroid abnormalities, can be autoimmune in nature and potentially indicate altered immunologic self-tolerance. Two patients experienced low TSH levels (hyperthyroidism) followed by abnormally high TSH; one also experienced increased titers of ATGA and symptoms consistent with hyperthyroidism. This pattern resembles some cases of immune-mediated thyroiditis seen in clinical practice and would be consistent with reduced self-tolerance to thyroid specific antigens. Administration of anti-PD-1 therapy requires a vigilant follow up for signs and symptoms consistent with autoimmune disease.One patient who received BMS-936558 10 mg/kg and achieved a significant clinical response had a marked grade 4 ALT elevation. In studies of solid tumors, ALT elevations have been observed in the absence of identifiable hepatic metastases, indicating the potential for non-specific hepatic inflammation. The ALT elevation in this subject occurred concomitant with a >4 log10 reduction of HCV RNA, a finding consistent with activation of HCV-specific, liver-directed T cell-mediated immunity in acute HCV infection [50]. Thus, it is possible that this ALT elevation was a specific result of the predicted mechanism of action of BMS-936558. Importantly, bilirubin and measures of hepatic function remained stable and the event resolved without intervention, concomitant with a return of HCV RNA towards baseline levels.In summary, this study establishes proof-of-concept that PD-1 blockade with BMS-936558 can lead to persistent suppression of HCV replication in some patients with chronic infection, including those who do not respond to interferon-alfa therapy. While the therapeutic application of this approach in HCV infection is limited by the recent, ongoing development of highly effective new treatments, the promising results of this study suggest that further exploration of PD-1 pathway blockade is warranted across other chronic viral diseases, possibly in combination with other immunomodulatory or direct-acting antiviral agents. The potential for autoimmune adverse events, or of activity-related hepatic inflammation in liver infections, will require further evaluation in a larger dataset following multiple-dose administration."
