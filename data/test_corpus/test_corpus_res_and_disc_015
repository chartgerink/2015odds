"In a recent study, four causal SNPs (rs4803219, rs28416813, rs8103142, and rs4803217) were associated with the two tagging SNPs that were most strongly associated with spontaneous HCV clearance (rs12979860 and rs8099917) [20]. In this study, the four causal SNPs and two tagged SNPs were genotyped along with two additional SNPs, rs11881222 and rs8113007, which are located in the second IL28B intron and 7.5 kb upstream of the IL28B gene, respectively (Figure 1). These eight SNPs were genotyped in a cohort of 197 HCV/HIV-1 coinfected patients from our clinic unit who received standard combined peg-IFN-α/RBV therapy. The clinical characteristics and HCV treatment responses of the197 HCV/HIV-1 coinfected patients included in the study are summarized in Table 1. Most patients were on antiretroviral therapy (n = 196, 99.5%), and most patients had controlled HIV-1 replication (n = 169, 86%). Eighty-three patients (42%) responded successfully to HCV treatment (i.e., achieved SVR). When the HIV-1 viral load was compared in the HIV-1 viremic patients (n = 28, 14%), no significant differences were observed between SVRs and patients failing therapy (p = 0.1612, Mann-Whitney U test). Similarly, the length of time patients were under antiretroviral treatment did not impact HCV SVR (p = 0.3439, Mann-Whitney U test). HCV genotype was significantly associated with SVR in our study cohort (p = 7.2×10−5) (Table 1). Unexpectedly, older patients were more likely to achieve HCV SVR (p = 0.0223) (Table 1). Nevertheless, the difference between the means was very limited (48.5 vs 47 years). A moderate association with SVR was also observed with patient AST liver enzyme level (p = 0.0353), and HCV viral load (p = 0.0120). These four clinical parameters are known to be associated with HCV treatment response. 10.1371/journal.pone.0031016.g001 Figure 1 IL28B gene locus and position of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) analyzed in this study. 10.1371/journal.pone.0031016.t001Table 1 Clinical characteristics of patients with chronic HIV-1 and HCV coinfection who were treated with peg-IFN-α/RBV therapy.

All major IL28B single-allele SNPs were highly associated with SVRs (Table 2). Three causal major alleles, rs28416813, rs8103142, and rs4803217, demonstrated the highest individual associations with SVRs (OR = 2.9, 95% CI = 1.8–4.6, p = 6.6×10−6) (Table 2). As shown in Table 3, genotype distributions of all tested IL28B SNPs were significantly different among patients experiencing an SVR to peg-IFN-α/RBV treatment. Again, the causal SNPs rs28416813, rs8103142, and rs4803217 demonstrated the highest associations with SVRs (OR = 3.7, 95% CI = 2.0–6.7, p = 1.3×10−5) (Table 3). The four causal variants were in high linkage disequilibrium among themselves (r2≥0.94) and with the tag rs12979860 variant (r2≥0.92) (Figure 2). Importantly, rs8099917 was in low linkage disequilibrium with the four causal variants (r2≤0.45) and with the rs12979860 variant (r2 = 0.45), demonstrating that this SNP was only moderately linked to the causal SNPs in the IL28B gene. Notably, the tag rs8113007 variant (which is separated from the rs8099917 SNP by only 72 nucleotides) displayed intermediate linkage with the tag rs12979860 (r2 = 0.78) and the causal IL28B gene SNPs (r2 = 0.77–0.82). The rs11881222 SNP, located in the second IL28B intron (Figure 1), was highly linked to both the causal IL28B SNPs (r2≥0.92) and the tag rs12979860 variant (r2 = 0.92) (Figure 2). 10.1371/journal.pone.0031016.g002 Figure 2 Pairwise linkage disequilibrium (LD) plot for the eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) analyzed in this study.

Numbers reflect the number of patients with indicated genotype. Haplotypes carrying major alleles at IL28B were most strongly associated with an SVR to peg-IFN-α/RBV therapy (OR = 2.5, 95% CI = 1.6–4.0, p = 4.0×10−5) (Table 4). These major haplotypes were visibly augmented in patients experiencing an SVR (Tables 2 and 4). Nevertheless, the prognostic value of the eight haplotypes together was not higher than the ORs obtained when the different haplotypes were analyzed individually (Table 2). Importantly, homozygosity for the three of the four causal IL28B gene SNPs, rs28416813, rs8103142, and rs4803217, was completely linked to the rs12979860 major CC genotype (r2 = 1.0). In contrast, the rs8099917 major TT genotype demonstrated a lower correlation with homozygosity of these three causal IL28B gene SNPs (r2 = 0.83).10.1371/journal.pone.0031016.t004Table 4 IL28B haplotype association with sustained virological response to peg-IFN-α/RBV therapy. rs4803217 rs11881222 rs8103142 rs28416813 rs4803219 rs12979860 rs8113007 rs8099917 OR (95% CI) p-value C A T C C C A T 2.5 (1.6–4.0) 4.0×10−5 A G C G T T T G 0.3 (0.1–0.5) 1.1×10−5 A G C G T T T T 0.9 (0.5–1.8) 0.8368 C A T C C C T G 2.8 (0.7–11.4) 0.1351 A A C G C T A T 0.3 (0.0–3.1) 0.3131 Major alleles are shown in bold. Prior work has documented the contribution of different IL28B-associated SNPs to spontaneous HCV clearance [7], [8], [9], [10], [22]. Specifically, di Iulio et al. report the strong association of four SNPs located in the promoter, coding, and 3′-untranslated regions of IL28B with spontaneous HCV clearance [20]. However, this study did not focus on patients treated with IFN-based therapies. In the present study, we tested the influence of four causal IL28B variants (rs4803219, rs28416813, rs8103142, and rs4803217) on SVR to peg-IFN-α/RBV therapy, and compared the relationships of these four causal SNPs with the tag IL28B variants rs12979860 and rs8099917.In the present cohort of HCV/HIV-1 coinfected patients, three major causal IL28B variant haplotypes (rs28416813, rs8103142, and rs4803217, located in the promoter, coding, and 3′-untranslated regions of IL28B) were highly associated with SVR to peg-IFN-α/RBV therapy. Moreover, these three haplotypes, which were in perfect linkage equilibrium among themselves (r2 = 1.0), had a higher odds ratio regarding HCV clearance than the three tag IL28B SNPs tested here (rs8099917, rs8113007, and rs12979860). Two of these tag SNPs, rs8099917 and rs12979860, demonstrated the strongest associations with HCV clearance in the above-mentioned genome-wide association studies and are currently being introduced in clinical algorithms to predict SVR to IFN-based therapies. Another important finding of our study is the strong linkage of the tag rs12979860 variant with the IL28B causal SNPs. Homozygosity for the tag rs12979860 variant completely tagged (r2 = 1.0) homozygosity for three major causal SNPs: rs28416813, rs8103142, and rs4803217. This result suggests that rs12979860 may be a better marker for IL28B phenotype than rs8099917 or rs8113007. These findings extend those of di Iulio et al., confirming that rs12979860 can be a better predictor for HCV clearance, as well as underscoring the strong association of causal IL28B SNPs with HCV clearance [20]. Most notably, to our knowledge this is the first study to investigate the association of IL28B tag and causal variants with patient response to peg-IFN-α/RBV therapy. These results provide compelling evidence for the relationship between IL28B tag and causal variants, and suggest possible involvement of the IL28B gene product, IFN-λ3, in SVR to IFN-based therapies. However, some limitations are worth noting. First, our study was restricted to an ethnically and epidemiologically homogeneous cohort of HCV/HIV-1 coinfected patients attending our clinic. Future work should include other ethnic and patient cohorts. Second, as previously suggested [20], functional studies are needed to precisely identify the host gene variants implicated in the control of HCV infection. Two studies found higher levels of IFN-λ2 and IFN-λ3 messenger RNAs in PBMCs from healthy individuals carrying the homozygous rs8099917 genotype associated with HCV clearance [8], [9]. However, another study observed no association between hepatic expression of IFN-λ2 and IFN-λ3 and rs8099917 genotype [23].In short, the data shown here strongly support the association of tag and causal IL28B variants with HCV clearance after IFN-based therapy. Nevertheless, there were patients carrying alleles associated with clearance who did not clear the virus, as well as patients that carrying alleles not associated with clearance who were able to clear the virus. These results suggest that further studies should be conducted to investigate IL28B genetics, as well as other genetic factors associated with HCV clearance."
