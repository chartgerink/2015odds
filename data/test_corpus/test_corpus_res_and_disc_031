"1. Clinical Characteristics 406 Chinese Han LC subjects caused by CHB and 406 HCC subjects caused by CHB were included in this study. There is no difference of age and gender between the two groups. There is no difference between the two groups in HBV copies and serology pattern.( Table 1). 2. Lab Results Liver function tests and coagulation tests were analyzed for both groups. There is no significant difference between two groups of total protein(TP) , but albumin decreased while bilirubin increased in LC patients than in HCC ones. Alanine Aminotransferase(ALT), Aspertate Aminotransferase(AST), alkaline phosphatase(ALP) and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase(GGT) were analyzed and all of them increased in HCC than in LC, but only ALT and GGT increased significantly(P<0.05) in HCC than in LC( Table 1). Prothrombin time (PT), international normalized ratio (INR), activated partial thromboplastin time(APTT) and fibrinogen(FIB) were analyzed for both groups. Coagulation time increased in LC group than in HCC ones (P<0.05) ( Table 1). 3. Genotype No departure from the Hardy–Weinberg distribution was observed for each genotype (p value always not significant) in control subjects and in patients with liver diseases. CHB patients who progress to LC or HCC showed a significant different frequency in rs12979860 (p = 0.046).Patients with HCC carried more frequently the T alleles in rs12979860 comparison to LC( Table 2). Same results were found in the independent sample.(Table 3). 10.1371/journal.pone.0050787.t002 Table 2 IL-28B SNPs in LC and HCC caused by HBV, group of CHB and health control. polymorphism LC(n = 406) HCC(n = 406) CHB(n = 393) Health control(n = 244) P LC vsHCC LC vshealth LC vsCHB HCC vshealth HCC vsCHB CHB vshealth IL-28B rs12979860 C/T Genotypes CC 365(89.9) 348(85.7) 330(84.0) 213(87.3) 0.046* 0.305 0.013* 0.570 0.250 0.250 CT 39(9.6) 53(13.1) 60(15.3) 29(11.9) TT 2(0.5) 5(1.2) 3(0.8) 2(0.8) CT+TT 41(10.1) 58(14.3) 63(16.03) 31(12.7) IL-28B rs12980275 A/G Genotypes AA 359(88.4) 347(85.5) 330(84.0) 210(86.1) 0.211 0.378 0.068 0.833 0.556 0.474 AG 44(10.8) 57(14.0) 61(15.5) 33(13.5) GG 3(0.7) 2(0.5) 2(0.5) 1(0.4) AG+GG 47(11.6) 59(14.5) 63(16.03) 34(13.93) IL-28B rs 8099917 A/C Genotypes AA 367(90.4) 356(87.7) 352(89.6) 218(89.3) 0.217 0.666 0.697 0.524 0.402 0.929 AC 38(9.4) 48(11.8) 40(10.2) 25(10.2) CC 1(0.25) 2(0.5) 1(0.3) 1(0.4) AC+CC 39(9.61) 50(12.3) 41(10.4) 26(10.66) Values are shown as number (frequency), Data is analyzed by chi-squre analyses. * refer to P<0.05. 10.1371/journal.pone.0050787.t003 Table 3 IL-28B SNPs in LC and HCC caused by HBV (verification by independent sample). polymorphism LC(n = 341) HCC(n = 356) X2 P IL-28B rs12979860 C/T Genotypes CC 310(90.9) 306(85.96) 4.162 0.041* CT+TT 31(9.1) 50(14.04) IL-28B rs12980275 A/G Genotypes AA 307(90.0) 304(85.4) 3.461 0.063 AG+GG 34(9.97) 52(14.6) IL-28B rs 8099917 A/C Genotypes AA 311(91.2) 312(87.6) 2.329 0.127 AC+CC 30(8.80) 44(12.4) Values are shown as number (frequency), Data is analyzed by chi-squre analyses. * refer to P<0.05. Because of the connection between these SNPs and HBV infection, we included CHB patients and health subjects as control to exclude the hypothesis of the SNPs and association with HBV infection. There is no significant difference of frequency in IL-28B (rs12979860) between HCC/LC and health control. There is significant difference between LC and CHB, but no significant difference between HCC and CHB. There is no significant difference between CHB and health control (Table 2). Logistic regression Logistic regression models were used for calculating odds ratios (95% confidence interval) and corresponding P-values for each SNP site and other clinical characteristics using SPSS. We do single factor regression first, all of these variable were included: RBC,HB,PLT,WBC,TB,DB,IB, ALT,AST, TP,ALB,GLB,ALP,GGT,NH3,PT,INR,APTT,TT,FIB,AFP,HBV-DNA,HBsAg, HBsAb,HBeAg,HBeAb,HBcAb, and IL-28B genotype. Then we chose whose P<0.05 to do multi factor regression. Age (continuous value) and sex (male  =  0, female  =  1) were adjusted by inclusion in logistic analysis as covariates. Gene polymorphism in IL-28B (rs12979860) was found to be significantly associated with HCC occurrence(P = 0.038, 95%CI of OR: 1.037∼1.381), whereas no significant associations were observed between other candidate gene polymorphisms and the HCC occurrence, nor other clinical characteristics.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer worldwide and the third most common cause of cancer mortality. Globally, Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is the most frequent underlying cause of HCC. In hyper-epidemic areas such as China and Africa, chronic HBV infection contributes to at least 80% of cases of HCC[10]. There is intense interest in cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying HBV-associated HCC incidence. However, due to the long duration (usually more than three decades) from HBV infection to HCC incidence and the complexity of carcinogenesis, mechanism underlies the HCC development in hepatitis B patients is poorly understood. Persistent inflammation was recognized to function as a driving force in the journey to HCC as well as in many other cancers. Longstanding liver inflammation leads to hepatic regeneration and fibrosis, which subsequently progresses to cirrhosis in some patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. HBV likely causes HCC via both indirect (necro-inflammation and regeneration injury) and direct (by integration of its DNA in the host genome) pathways[11]. During the process of inflammation, cytokines play the most important role [12].Recently, more and more attention was paid to IL-28B, it seems to play a central role in the immune response towards viral infections; in particular, type III IFN demonstrates to possess potent antiviral and immune-stimulation activities in response to poxvirus infection. IL-28B polymorphisms are linked with a better response to antiviral treatment in patients with HCV chronic hepatitis and to a higher probability to clear the virus during the natural history of chronic HCV infection[13]. We guess IL-28B may play a role in immune response of the process and progress of hepatitis. So this study wants to explore whether IL-28B polymorphisms are linked with the outcome of HBV infection and inflammation, whether IL-28B polymorphisms are linked with HCC occurrence.We conducted in HBV-infected patients who have progressed to HCC or LC. Age and gender were matched. Liver function tests and coagulation tests were analyzed to explore the difference between stages such as LC and HCC. There is no difference between the two groups in HBV copies and serology pattern. This can exclude above inference factors. There is no significant difference between two groups of total protein(TP) , but albumin decreased while bilirubin increased in LC patients than in HCC ones. ALT and GGT increased significantly in HCC patients than in LC. This indicates that the liver injury is heavier in HCC than in LC. But jaundice degree is much light in HCC. In order to know whether the level of serum enzymes and coagulation tests are strictly associated with progress to carcinoma, we use logistic regression models to analysis which factor may be the most important one in the progress of hepatitis. Many clinical characteristics were included, such as liver function tests, serum enzymes, coagulation tests, virus DNA load, and so on. Gene polymorphism in IL-28B (rs12979860) was found to be significantly associated with HCC occurrence, whereas no significant associations were observed between other factors and HCC occurrence. The most important factors may become predictive tests for forecast unhealthy progress including carcinoma.A novel finding concerns the demonstration of a strict association between IL-28B rs12979860 C/T polymorphism and the occurrence of HCC. The carriage of the T alleles in rs12979860 was strictly associated with the presence of HCC in our subjects in whom the presence of liver cancer was actively searched in the liver and confirmed at histology. The trends in genotype frequencies are highly significantly different between these two groups. Carriage of the T alleles in rs12979860 were found to be independent predictor of the presence of HCC in multivariate analysis. If confirmed, these data could have important clinical consequences in the selection of cirrhotic patients for whom screening for early HCC detection might need to be intensified.This phenomenon can be explained as following: first, genotype CC was indicated to be associated with virus clearing, thus HBV may stay much longer in those patients who with the mutation allele T[14], so T alleles in rs12979860 was associated with HCC occurrence. Second, IFN therapy inhibits hepatic carcinogenesis in patients with chronic hepatitis B[15], this indicates that IL-28B with mutation type can’t function normally, they can’t inhibits carcinogenesis effectively, and resulted in malignant progress and outcome. Third, the predictive time of this test is much earlier than abdomen B ultrasonic and the results are much sensitive and specific than other tests such as liver function tests and biopsy.In conclusion, IL-28B T alleles in rs12979860 appear to be more prevalent in patients with HCC. They are functionally important in determining disease outcome. Among patients of liver cirrhosis, especially those with HBV infection, carriage of this allele seems to enhance the risk for developing HCC. Our study is useful for HCC surveillance and has implications for novel personalized therapy strategy development aiming at HCC."
