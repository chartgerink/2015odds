"Baseline characteristics The clinical characteristics and the treatment responses of the146 HBV/HCV dually -infected patients in the study are presented in Table 1. Overall, there was no significant difference in our study cohort between the SVR and NVR groups with respect to age, gender, body mass index(BMI), liver enzyme levels, platelet count ,HCV RNA viral load , HBV genotype, and fibrosis stage (all P>0.05). However, the HCV genotype frequencies were significantly different between the NVR and SVR groups (P=0.01). HBV DNA viral load was higher in the NVR groups as compared with the SVR groups (P=0.001). Remarkable differences were also detected in differences HBeAg status, HBsAg-positive patients were more predominant in the NVR group (P=0.042). The genotype distribution of HBV was B in 59 (40%), C in 73 (50%) and non-classified in 14 (10%) of the patients due to undetectable viral genomes or too-weak signals of PCR products for further genotyping.  10.1371/journal.pone.0077911.t001Table 1 Clinical Characteristics of patients with chronic HBV and HCV dual-infection and treated with peg-IFN-a/RBV therapy.

The prevalence of IL28B genotypes with response to PEG-IFN-α/RBV treatment The genotype and allele distributions of the IL28B rs8099917 and rs12979860 polymorphisms are summarized in Table 2. The overall distributions of the genotypes between the NVR and SVR groups were significantly different (P<0.05). For rs8099917, the TG+GG variant of rs8099917 SNP was associated with NVR (58.1% in the NVR group and 34.5% in the SVR group). Logistic regression analysis showed that compared with patients with the TT genotype, those with the TG genotype had an increased risk of NVR (odds ratio [OR] =2.37, 95%confidence interval [CI] =1.16–4.83, P=0.017), and the GG genotype was associated with a further increased risk of NVR (OR=4.23, 95%CI=1.17–15.33, P=0.027). Complicated TG with GG genotype together, G variant genotypes (TG+GG) also had an increased risk of NVR, and there was a significant trend for a dose-effect of the G allele on the risk of NVR. Moreover, compared with T allele carriers, G allele carriers had a significantly higher risk of NVR (OR= 2.25, 95%CI =1.33–3.82, P=0.002). For rs12979860, the CT+TT genotype was also associated with NVR (58.1% in NVR, 40.4% in SVR). Logistic regression analysis showed that, compared with patients with the CC genotype, the risk of NVR increased in those with the TT genotype (OR=5.77 95% CI=1.09–30.62, P=0.040), but the risk of NVR increased in those patients with the CT genotype was not observed (OR =1.80 95% CI=0.91-3.59, P=0.092). Complicated CT with TT genotype together, T variant genotypes (CT+TT) also had an increased risk of NVR, and there was a significant trend for a dose-effect of the T allele on the risk of NVR (OR= 2.04, 95%CI =1.05-3.97, P=0.037). Similarly, compared with C allele carriers, T allele carriers had a significantly higher risk of NVR (OR=1.88, 95% CI =1.11-3.17, P=0.018). In short, rs8099917 and rs12979860 were strongly linked with response to PEG-IFN-α/RBV treatment in HBV/ HCV dually-infected patients. 10.1371/journal.pone.0077911.t002Table 2 The prevalence of IL28B genotypes with response to PEG-IFN-α/RBV treatment.

The proportion of patients infected with HCV G1 who experienced NVR (51.9%) was significantly higher than in patients infected with HCV Non-G1 (30.8%). Compared with Non-G1 carriers, G1 carriers had a significantly higher risk of NVR (OR=2.42, 95% CI =1.22-4.80, P=0.01) (Table 3). Among patients infected with HCV G1, the association between NVR and the unfavorable rs8099917 with the TG+GG genotype was significant (P=0.009); however, in patients infected with HCV non-G1, the association was not observed (P=0.896). 10.1371/journal.pone.0077911.t003Table 3 Treatment response according to IL28B (rs8099917) genotype in HCV G1 and non-G1 group.

Univariate analyses of the factors correlated with HBV virological response and reactivation of HBV Of the 146 dually-infected patients who completed the treatment and post-treatment follow-up evaluation. 67(45.9%) had detectable serum HBV DNA pretreatment, 79 Patients (54.1%) had undetectable levels. The rate of HBV viological response was signiﬁcantly different between patients with TT and TG+GG genotypes (57.9% vs. 31.0%, p=0.029). Moreover, the reactivation rate of HBV DNA with G variant (TG+GG) was signiﬁcantly higher than that of patients without the G variant (41.7% vs .13.9%, p=0.005). In addition, HBeAg-negative patients had a higher frequency of HBV response and a lower frequency of reactivation of HBV than HBeAg-positive patients (P=0.039 and P=0.017, respectively). However, There were no significant differences in the rate of HBV response or reactivation of HBV between HBV genotype B and C patients (P=0.187 and P=0.390 respectively) (Table 4). 10.1371/journal.pone.0077911.t004Table 4 Univariate analyses of the factors correlated with HBV virological response and reactivation of HBV.

Multivariate logistic regression analyses of the factors correlated with HCV- NVR To further examine the relative contribution of factors associated with NVR in HCV G1 and HCV non-G1 patients, we used a logistic regression model. When adjusting for baseline levels of HBV DNA and HCV RNA viral loads, HBeAg status, ALT, age, gender, BMI, we found that the G allele of rs8099917 was the most significant factor for predicting HCV-NVR in HCV G1 patients (OR = 10.2, 95% CI =2.51–41.7, P = 0.001), followed by HBV DNA viral load (OR = 3.22, 95% CI =2.46–5.50, P = 0.030). Full analysis suggested that the presence of rs8099917 G variant was a most important predictive factor of NVR before PEG-IFN-α/RBV therapy in HCV/HBV patients with the HCV-G1. Whereas, when adjusting for the same parameters, the rs8099917 G variant was not a signiﬁcant predictor of NVR in non-G1 patients (P=0.361) (Table 5). 10.1371/journal.pone.0077911.t005Table 5 Factors associated with NVR by multivariate logistic regression.

It is important to design and perform therapeutic trials to determine the best treatment for dually-infected patients. To our best knowledge, this is the first Chinese cohort study to examine the virological effects using IL28B polymorphisms in dual infection patients. Results of the current study indicate that patients with the rs8099917 TG+GG and rs12979860 TC+CC genotypes had a higher likelihood of NVR and a lower chance of SVR, similar to previous reports[17,26,27].This strategy could conceivably play a very important role in clinical setting. Adverse drug reactions could then avoided in patients unlikely to benefit from treatment, and the substantial cost of PEG-IFN-α/RBV treatment could be reduced.Recently, many studies have confirmed the importance of different IL28B SNPs in the natural course and IFN-based treatment outcomes of HCV and HBV infection [16,17,28]. In the current study, we found that rs8099917 G variants (TG+GG) and rs12979860 T variants (CT+TT) carriers had a significantly higher risk of NVR ,similar to previously reported findings for HCV-mono-infected patients [16,26]. It is widely accepted that both host and virus factors can influence the treatment response [27,29,30]. However, there have been limited data regarding the prevalence of HCV genotypes and IL-28B SNP to their impact on outcomes in patients with HBV/HCV dual infections. Interestingly, when we analyzed the relationship between IL28B genotype and NVR separately for G1 and non-G1 subjects, we found that rs8099917 G variants (TG+GG) interact with HCV G1 to result in a higher risk of NVR. In contrast, the rate of NVR in patients infected with non-G1 types was not affected by rs8099917 genotype, suggesting that the predictive value of genotyping this SNP may limited to patients infected with G1. Nevertheless, the small number of non-G1 infected patients in our study prevented us from drawing conclusions about the predictive value. Overall, we showed that a combination of HCV genotype and IL-28B genotype may provide clinically powerful predictive values. IL28B SNP now may guide clinical decision making regarding whether or not to initiate therapy, how long to continue therapy, in order to avoid unpleasant side effects associated with treatment of HCV/HBV dually- infected patients.Little is known about the HBV reactivation with PEG-IFN-α/RBV among HBV/HCV dually-infected patients. In this study, we found that the IL28 SNP genotype and HBeAg status were associated with HBV DNA reactivation. The reactivation rate of HBV DNA of the patients with G carriage (TG+GG) was significantly higher than those TT. Moreover, HBeAg-positive patients had a lower frequency of HBV response and a higher frequency of reactivation of HBV. These results were very similar to those reported in a large community-based follow-up study in HBV mono-infected patients [31,32]. Given the risk of HBV reactivation in G carriage or HBeAg-positive patients, clinicians should exercise caution when treating these patients. Therefore, close virological monitoring of HBV/HCV dual-infected patients after PEG-IFN-α/RBV therapies is absolutely necessary. Moreover, multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that G variant was an important predictive factor of HCV NVR in patients infected with HCV G1, but not in patients infected with HCV non-G1. In HCV G1 subgroup, HBV DNA level also contribute to HCV NVR, this results indicated that patients with G variant interact with high levels of HBV DNA might be able to achieve a high rate of HCV NVR. Intriguingly, we found that HBeAg status was an independent predictive factors of HCV NVR in HCV non-G1 subgroup, this findings indicated that HBeAg status might be more important to predict HCV NVR than genetic variation. However, it is possible that such a finding is attributable to the relatively small numbers of subjects in our cohort. Further studies of cohorts with large cases or different ethnic profiles will be necessary to determine whether there are differences between HCV G1 and non-G1 in dually-infected patients in regard to the predictive value of IL28B genotyping."
