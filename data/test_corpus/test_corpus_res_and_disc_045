"Demographic and Clinical Characteristics of the Study Population
The baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of the participants are presented in Table 1. A total of 2,192 participants were included in this analysis; 1,511 participants were enrolled in the 1994–95 cohort (1,169 [77.4%] African American, 342 [22.6%] European American) and 681 were enrolled in 2001–2002 cohort (598 [87.8%] African American, 83 [12.2%] European American). Overall, the median age at enrollment was 36 years, the majority (74.2%) was HIV positive and the median lifetime number of sex partners was 12 (IQR: 6–50). 10.1371/journal.pone.0138827.t001

HSV antibody data were available for 1,431 (94.7%) of the 1,511 women enrolled in 1994–1995, representing 65.3% of our full analytic cohort. In this group, 72.8% of women were HSV–1 seropositive (77.3% of African Americans and 57.3% of European Americans) and 79.0% were HSV–2 seropositive (83.9% of African Americans and 62.2% of European Americans). The vast majority of women was seropositive for either HSV–1 or HSV–2 (94.5% overall; 97.4% of African Americans and 84.5% of European Americans); 57.4% were seropositive for both HSV–1 and HSV–2.
The prevalence of antibodies to HSV–1 and HSV–2 did not vary significantly by IFNL4-ΔG/TT genotype among either African American or European American participants (Table 2). Among African American women, the proportion positive for either HSV–1 or HSV–2 was 97.0% in those with the IFNL4-TT/TT genotype and 97.4% in the IFNL4-ΔG allele carriers (P = 0.75). Among European American participants, those proportions were 86.6% and 83.1%, respectively (p = 0.39). Similar results were seen for genotype comparisons for HSV–1 and HSV–2 separately. Thus, the data provide no evidence that IFNL4-ΔG/TT genotype affects susceptibility to HSV infections. 10.1371/journal.pone.0138827.t002

0.39 Oral Herpes Episodes
A total of 1,511 women enrolled in the 1994–95 cohort contributed 9,322 visits to this analysis. An episode of oral herpes was reported at 5.3% of these visits, 3.7% of visits among African Americans and 10.7% of visits among European Americans. There was no evidence that IFNL4-ΔG/TT was associated with recurrent oral herpes (Table 3). Comparing women with the IFNL4-ΔG/ΔG or IFNL4-ΔG/TT genotype (i.e., women who can generate IFN-λ4 protein) to those with the IFNL4-TT/TT genotype (i.e., women who cannot generate IFN-λ4) yielded an aOR of 1.1 (95% CI: 0.7–1.7; p = 0.58) in African American women and a similar result in the European American women (aOR, 1.2; 95% CI: 0.8–1.9; p = 0.44). When results for African Americans and European American individuals were combined in an analysis that was adjusted for age, HIV status and race, the aOR was 1.2 (95% CI: 0.8–1.6; p = 0.35). 10.1371/journal.pone.0138827.t003

2Adjusted for age and HIV status Linkage disequilibrium (r2) between IFNL4-ΔG and rs12979860-T, the variant examined in the previous study of genetic associations with oral herpes [13], was 0.99 in European Americans and 0.87 in African Americans, therefore, we observed similar results (aOR, 1.1; 95% CI: 0.8–1.6) for rs12979860 genotype. Likewise, sensitivity analyses that were stratified by HIV status or restricted to women who were HSV–1 seropositive yielded similarly non-significant results (S1 Table). In contrast to the null genotype findings for the IFNL4-ΔG/TT variant, women who were infected with HIV reported oral herpes episodes much more frequently than HIV-uninfected women (aOR, 4.31; 95% CI: 2.84–6.55; p<0.0001), thus verifying the validity of the self-reported data. Our results, therefore, provide no support for the hypothesis that the IFNL4-ΔG allele increases the risk of recurrent oral herpes. Genital Herpes Episodes
A total of 2,192 women contributed 44,828 visits for the analysis of genital herpes (Table 4). At 7.5% of visits, a woman reported that she had suffered an episode of genital herpes during the previous 6 months. Genital herpes was reported at 8.2% of visits by African American women and 8.7% of visits by European Americans. IFNL4-ΔG/TT genotype was not associated with frequency of self-reported genital herpes episodes (Table 4) with an aOR of 1.1 (95% CI: 0.9–1.4; p = 0.55) for African Americans and 1.0 (95% CI: 0.7–1.4; p = 0.99) for European Americans comparing IFNL4-ΔG/ΔG or IFNL4-ΔG/TT genotype to IFNL4-TT/TT genotype; results for African and European Americans combined were: aOR 1.0 (95% CI: 0.9–1.3; p = 0.71). 10.1371/journal.pone.0138827.t004

2Missing participants: African Americans, 6; European American, 1 A genital ulcer was noted during clinical exam at 2.2% of visits, 2.4% and 1.4% of visits for African Americans and European Americans, respectively (Table 4). Similar to the results for self-reported genital herpes, the frequency of clinician-observed genital ulcers did not vary by genotype, with an aOR of 1.2 (95% CI: 0.9–1.6; p = 0.31) for African Americans and 0.8 (95% CI: 0.5–1.4; p = 0.50) for European Americans comparing IFNL4-ΔG/ΔG or IFNL4-ΔG/TT genotype to IFNL4-TT/TT genotype; results for African and European Americans combined were: aOR 1.1 (95% CI: 0.8–1.4; p = 0.53). Similar to the results for oral herpes, we found no evidence that the frequency of genital herpes varies by IFNL4-ΔG/TT genotype. HSV–2 DNA in CVL Specimens
We also examined the relationship between IFNL4-ΔG/TT genotype and results of HSV–2 DNA measurements in CVL samples taken from a subset of 322 women (Table 5). In these participants, 27 (8.4%) individuals had detectable HSV–2 viral DNA (i.e., viral shedding). The proportion of women shedding HSV–2 virus did not differ by IFNL4-ΔG/TT genotype (aOR, 0.7; 95% CI: 0.3–1.9; p = 0.49, comparing IFNL4-ΔG/ΔG or IFNL4-ΔG/TT genotype to IFNL4-TT/TT genotype). Among the women with detectable HSV–2 DNA, the median viral level was 4.4 log10 DNA copies/mL for IFNL4-ΔG carriers and 3.2 log10 DNA copies/mL for those with the IFNL4-TT/TT genotype (p = 0.6831). These results provide no evidence that IFNL4-ΔG/TT genotype affects shedding of HSV–2 DNA. 10.1371/journal.pone.0138827.t005

2Analysis of HSV–2 DNA levels are limited to women with detectable virus
3Kruskal-Wallis test (IFNL4-TT/TT was used as the reference group) In this study of more than 2,000 women who were followed prospectively in the WIHS cohort, no associations were observed between IFNL4-ΔG/TT genotype and the frequency of self-reported oral herpes, self-reported genital herpes or clinician-observed genital ulcers. Additionally, no associations were observed between IFNL4-ΔG/TT genotype and HSV seroprevalence (either HSV–1 or HSV–2); HSV–2 viral shedding or HSV–2 DNA levels in cervical lavage specimens. On the basis of these results, it does not appear that the IFN-λ4 protein plays a role in susceptibility to herpes virus infections or the frequency of recurrence.We believe ours is the first study to examine the potential association between genetic variants in the IFN-λ region and genital herpes, however, a previous study found rs12979860-T, which is in strong linkage disequilibrium with the IFNL4-ΔG allele, to be associated with more frequent and severe episodes of oral herpes [13]. Some differences in the two studies should be noted. Our analysis was based on prospective observation of 1511 women with 15,592 person-visits and, therefore, had considerably greater statistical power than the previous study of 56 subjects. WIHS investigators asked subjects whether they had experienced an episode of oral herpes in the past six months, whereas Griffiths et al [13] categorized patients based on parameters that included the number of episodes/year, the size of the lesion and whether a patient had long lasting symptoms that required antiviral therapy. Therefore, while our large study provides strong evidence that IFN-λ region genetic variants are not associated with the frequency of recurrent oral herpes, it is possible that IFNL4-ΔG/TT genotype could play a role in controlling the severity of HSV infection. Given that that IFNL4-ΔG is a common allele, this genetic variant might require the presence of other, less common, factors to promote severe recurrent HSV infection. Thus, further investigation of the potential relationship between IFNL4-ΔG/TT genotype and severe oral herpes is warranted.There were several strengths of this study. Our study included more than 2,000 participants with up to 18 years of follow-up time; therefore we were well powered to observe an association between herpes recurrence and IFNL4-ΔG/TT genotype if one existed. Additionally, our study was nested within an established cohort with standardized sample collection and procedures as well as reliable clinical ascertainment of genital herpes.This study provides no evidence that the IFNL4-ΔG allele plays a role in oral or genital herpes; however, this variant could influence the pathogenesis of viral infections beyond HCV. The IFNL4-ΔG allele, which generates IFN-λ4 protein and is unfavorable for HCV clearance, underwent very strong negative genetic selection with replacement of the ancestral IFNL4–ΔG allele by the derived IFNL4-TT variant in non-African populations [10]. It seems unlikely that this selection was driven by HCV because the risk factors accounting for the bulk of HCV transmission (blood transfusions, contaminated medical injections and injection drug use) arose primarily in the 20th century and because HCV usually causes a slowly progressive chronic infection that is unlikely to markedly impair host reproduction. It seems likely, therefore, that this selection was driven by one or more other infectious agents. Future studies should focus on the potential role of IFNL4-ΔG/TT genotype in other infections."
