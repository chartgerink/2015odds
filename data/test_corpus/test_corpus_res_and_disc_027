"IL28B and response to HCV treatment in the HCV/HIV coinfected cohort Among 231 HCV/HIV coinfected subjects included in this study (baseline characteristics are shown in Table 1), 197 had HCV genotypes 1 or 4 and 34 had genotypes 2 or 3. Complete EVR (cEVR) and SVR rates among those with genotypes 1 or 4 were 36.5% and 30% respectively. In contrast, cEVR and SVR rates among those with genotypes 2 or 3 were 94%, and 70% respectively. We observed a strong association between IL28B genotype and response to therapy among those with genotypes 1 or 4 (Table 2). The odds ratios for cEVR and SVR were 2.98 [1.7–5.3] and 3.4 [1.7–6.9], respectively, with each additional copy of the C allele of rs12979860 (Figure 1). The association between IL28B genotype and response to PEG and WBR treatment in this coinfected cohort was independent of age, sex, ethnicity, baseline HCV viral load, or cirrhosis as shown in the multivariate logistic regression model presented in Table 2. In this model both the baseline HCV viral load and IL28B genotype emerged as strong and independent predictors of response to PEG/RBV treatment. Furthermore, when adjusting for all three SNPs in a multivariate logistic regression model (model not shown), only rs12979860 was associated with response to HCV treatment, consistent with these SNPs all being in strong linkage disequilibrium with each other. 10.1371/journal.pone.0025753.g001 Figure 1 Bar graph showing percent of subjects with different IL28B SNPs achieving SVR stratified by ethnicity. 10.1371/journal.pone.0025753.t001Table 1 Baseline Characteristics of 231 subjects included in our study.

A statistically significant association between IL28B genotype and response to HCV treatment was not observed among subjects with genotypes 2 or 3 (Table 3a), nor was the responder rs12979860 CC genotype overrepresented in those subjects (Table 3b). A statistically non-significant trend for higher SVR was observed among those with the rs12979860 CC genotype vs. CT/TT (80% vs. 65%) (P = 0.67) (Table 3a). However, the number of subjects with genotypes 2/3 included in our study was likely too small (n = 34) to permit definitive conclusions. 10.1371/journal.pone.0025753.t003Table 3 IL28B among HCV/HIV coinfected subjects with HCV genotypes 2 or 3.

The responder genotype CC at the rs12979860 locus had a lower frequency among black subjects (17%) as compared to whites (45%) and Hispanics (26%). These ethnic differences were less pronounced for the rs8099917 and rs12980275 SNPs. 10.1371/journal.pone.0025753.t004Table 4 Genotype distribution of the three IL28B SNPs in each ethnic group.

Significant proportions of the lower response rates among blacks were attributed to differences in the distribution of the IL28B responder allele at the rs12979860 locus among blacks. Indeed, after adjusting for IL28B genotype (rs12979860), the odds ratio for SVR among blacks compared to whites were 0.68 [0.33–1.4] (Table 5). 10.1371/journal.pone.0025753.t005Table 5 Association between black race and SVR unadjusted and adjusted for rs12979860.

To construct this prediction score, we calculated the area under the ROC for prediction of cEVR and SVR from a model that included IL28B genotype (rs12979860) and pretreatment HCV viral load. The area under the ROC for cEVR and SVR was 0.74 and 0.78 respectively (Hosmer–Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test, 0.6 and 0.92) (Figure 2). We then converted odds ratio estimates of these predictors to a simple 12-point system based on their strength of association with cEVR and SVR. The pretreatment NPV for achieving cEVR and SVR for a cut-off score of ≤3 was 88% and 93%, respectively (Table 6). 10.1371/journal.pone.0025753.g002 Figure 2 Area under ROC for predicting SVR from a model including IL28B genotype (rs12979860) and baseline HCV viral load. 10.1371/journal.pone.0025753.t006Table 6 Prediction score for complete EVR and SVR.

Since the striking association between SNPs on chromosome 19 surrounding the IL28B gene and response to PEG/WBR were reported, multiple confirmatory studies have replicated these findings in cohorts with different racial backgrounds and extended them to subjects with HCV/HIV coinfection. [15], [16], [17], [24], [25], [26], [28] Common limitations to some of these studies were their retrospective nature, which made them susceptible to selection bias and less stringent outcomes ascertainment, and lack of ethnic diversity. [24], [25], [26], [28] In this study we confirmed the association between SNPs surrounding the IL28B gene and response to HCV treatment in a prospective multicenter study of HCV/HIV coinfected subjects with different ethnic backgrounds and in whom EVR, cEVR, and SVR were prospectively ascertained in the context of the ACTG A5178 clinical trial.[30] Furthermore, we showed that ethnic differences in the distribution of the IL28B SNPs exist between black and white subjects. These differences explain some of the poor PEG/WBR response rates in black coinfected subjects compared to whites.Contrary to reports from other HCV/HIV coinfected cohorts [24], [25], [26], our study showed that the association between IL28B alleles and HCV treatment outcomes is largely additive, where subjects heterozygous for the responder IL28B alleles had intermediate HCV treatment success rates compared to those who are homozygote or did not possess a copy of these alleles. A similar trend was recently reported by another study of an HCV monoinfected cohort with advanced liver fibrosis. [21] In addition, a recent study by Dill and colleagues showed that hepatic expression of IL28B is decreased in the non-responder (rs12979860) TT genotype as compared to CT or CC [31], a finding previously suggested by another group in peripheral blood. [17] Furthermore, Dill and colleagues showed that differences in interferon stimulated gene (ISGs) expression between those with CT and CC genotypes disappeared after stratification by PEG/WBR treatment response, leading them to conclude that differences in ISG between IL28B alleles shown by other groups in unstratified analyses were likely due to unequal assignment of non-responders to the heterozygote IL28B group. [32], [33], [34] Although these findings need to be confirmed, they argue that quantification of hepatic ISG expression is a better predictor of SVR among subjects heterozygous for the IL28B allele. However, this is not a practical approach in routine clinical practice.The IL28B gene encodes IFN-λ3, which along with IFN-λ1 and IFN-λ2 constitute the type III interferons. HCV RNA in hepatocytes is sensed by pattern recognition receptors, which in turn induce expression of IFN-λ, from both plasmacytoid dendritic cells and hepatocytes. When these interferons bind their cognate receptors on hepatocytes and antigen presenting cells in the liver, they upregulate hundreds of ISGs with potent endogenous anti-HCV activity through activation of the Jak-STAT signaling pathway and likely convergence with the type I IFN (IFNα and β) pathway. [19], [35]An interplay between variable activation of these host endogenous interferon pathways and multiple viral resistance mechanisms, such as amino acid substitutions at positions 70 and 91 of the HCV core protein, accumulation of substitutions in the interferon sensitivity regions (ISDR) of the NS5A protein, and viral recruitment of liver-specific micro RNA (miR-122) to enhance its abundance, may functionally determine the pretreatment HCV viral population and its potential response to exogenous interferon administration.[36], [37], [38], [39], [40] These host and viral factors have been shown to be independent in predicting HCV treatment outcomes [22], [23], [33], and as such, can explain why both the IL28B genotype and baseline HCV viral load emerged in our study as strong and independent predictors of PEG/WBR response.A simple genetic test for the rs12979860 genotype is now commercially available in the United State. [41] However, as shown by us and others, IL28B genotype is not perfect in predicting treatment outcomes or completely precluding subjects homozygous for the non-responder alleles from achieving SVR. This is likely due to the complexity of viral-host interactions and variable expression of ISGs even among subjects with favorable IL28B genotypes. [31] To that end, we have developed a prediction score capitalizing on the negative predictive value of two strong and consistently reported predictors of HCV treatment outcomes (IL28B genotype and baseline HCV viral load).This simple pretreatment prediction score enabled us to achieve a high negative predictive value for SVR (93%) in this difficult to treat HCV/HIV coinfected cohort. If applied to the SLAM-C cohort prior to HCV therapy, it would have identified 67 subjects with unfavorable pretreatment scores (≤3 points) and minimized their unnecessary exposure to potentially harmful therapy. Furthermore, 58 SLAM-C subjects had less favorable IL28B genotypes but low baseline HCV viral load enabling them to achieve a favorable pretreatment prediction score (>3 points), where IL28B genotype as a sole measure was not an accurate predictor of their HCV treatment outcome to justify excluding them from therapy based on this measure alone (Figure 3).Medrano and colleagues have previously derived and validated a prediction score for achieving SVR in predominantly white HCV/HIV coinfected cohort from Spain [28]. The variable included in their prediction score were IL28B genotype rs12979860 (CT or TT vs. CC), liver stiffness assessed by transient elastography (FirboScan), HCV genotype (1 and 4 vs. 2 and 3), and baseline HCV viral load. Their prediction score had a higher area under the ROC than ours (0.892 vs. 0.78). However, this was likely secondary to having a predominantly white cohort, inclusion of HCV genotype as a predictor of outcome, and the inclusion of subjects who only completed a full course of therapy with documented outcomes. Nonetheless, their finding complements our by confirming the importance of IL28B genotype and baseline HCV viral load as independent predictors of HCV treatment outcomes.The strengths of our study include its relatively large sample size, prospective design and outcome ascertainment in the context of a multicenter clinical trial, and inclusion of racial minorities. Several limitations deserve comment. First, SVR was assessed after 72 weeks of therapy. This can be viewed as strength rather than a weakness, since extending the treatment duration would have likely minimized false negative outcomes given the emphasis on the negative predictive value for SVR in our prediction score. Second, about a third of the cohort was interferon experienced. However, this should have had little influence on retreatment outcomes as related to IL28B polymorphisms. Furthermore, our derived score predicted null virologic response, an outcome unlikely to change with repeat PEG/WBR treatment. Third, we lacked an appropriate validation cohort to validate our prediction score; thus, appropriate validation is needed before incorporating this score in clinical HCV treatment algorithms. Finally, it is unclear how information about IL28B gene polymorphisms will incorporated in HCV/HIV treatment algorithms in the era of direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy for HCV; it could be that it would assist triaging patients to conventional vs. DAA therapy to minimize risk for development of DAA resistance.In conclusion, we have shown that SNPs in regions surrounding the IL28B gene are associated with PEG/RBV treatment outcomes in a prospective study of HCV/HIV coinfected persons. These alleles have an additive dose effect and explain some of the racial differences in HCV treatment outcomes between blacks and whites. An HCV pretreatment prediction score that found a high negative predictive value for the IL28B non-responder homozygote genotype and high baseline HCV viral load, was able to identify a significant number of coinfected subjects with very low pretreatment likelihood to respond to peg-IFN and RBV. Future approaches to integrate a simple prediction model into the HCV-HIV coinfection management would appear to be warranted to limit potentially harmful exposure to this vulnerable population."
