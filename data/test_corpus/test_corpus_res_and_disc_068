"Baseline characteristics of the CHC patients and factors affected pre-treatment HCV RNA levels
The baseline characteristics of the CHC patients were listed in table 1. Total 31 subjects under lipid-lowering (6 subjects), glucose-lowering (12 subjects) or anti-hypertension medications (26 subjects) had been excluded from the study. The pre-treatment HCV RNA and HCV core Ag levels in G1 patients were significantly higher than those of G2 patients, while the SVR rate was higher in the G2 patients relative to the G1 patients. No correlation was found between the HCV core Ag and any of the lipid profile items.

Additionally, G1 patients exhibited significantly higher post-treatment TG levels (134.56±84.46 vs. 108.38±64.45 mg/dL, p = 0.032) and TG/HDL ratios (3.27±3.11 vs. 2.34±1.95, p = 0.037) than G2 patients. Differences between those with and without baseline IR after SVR: increases in Apo AI and HDL levels but decreases in HOMA-IR, C-peptide and HbA1c levels were noted in patients with baseline IR, but not in those without
Among those with SVR, patients with baseline IR exhibited increased post-treatment lipid profiles, including the HDL and Apo AI levels (Table 4). However, no reversal of Apo B was observed. Moreover, some glucose profiles, including the levels of HOMA-IR, C-peptide and HbA1c, decreased. In contrast, in patients without baseline IR, Apo B rather than Apo AI levels increased; furthermore, glucose, insulin and HOMA-IR increased after SVR. However, none of the post-treatment glucose profiles reached the criteria for diabetes or IR.

Differences between G1 and G2 patients without baseline IR after SVR: G2 patients demonstrated increased HDL and Apo AI levels, while G1 patients demonstrated increased TG levels, TG/HDL ratios and HOMA-IR levels
Among the G1 (n = 65) and G2 (n = 67) patients without baseline IR who achieved SVR (Figure 1), G2 patients showed increased HDL and Apo AI levels, while G1 patients exhibited increased TG levels, TG/HDL ratios and HOMA-IR levels. However, the increased post-treatment HOMA-IR in G1 patients did not reach the criteria for IR or diabetes. Besides, G1 patients had significantly higher post-treatment TG levels (130.89±73.73 vs. 100.88±51.82 mg/dL, p = 0.044) and TG/HDL ratios (3.11±2.84, vs. 2.01±1.42, p = 0.041) than G2 patients.

The most compelling findings of the current study are as follows: (1) Although the HCV viral clearance in both G1 and G2 patients resulted in increases in most lipid profile items, post-therapeutic increases in HDL and Apo AI levels were found only in G2 patients; increased TG/HDL ratios were found only in G1 patients. Moreover, after SVR, G2 patients had lower post-treatment TG/HDL ratios and TG levels than G1 patients. (2) Among the patients without baseline IR, G1 patients had increased post-treatment HOMA-IR levels, in contrast to G2 patients. (3) Among the patients with baseline IR, part of the lipid profile including Apo AI and HDL levels increased and part of glucose profile including HOMA-IR, C-peptide and HbA1c levels decreased significantly after viral clearance.The prevalences of G1 CHC increased with age, while that of G2 CHC decreased with age [21]. However, in the current and other studies enrolled CHC patients consecutively [22], except pre-treatment HCV RNA, no other baseline characteristics, including age, were different between the G1 and G2 patients. Besides, in white patients with G1 CHC, the favorable IL28B rs12979860 CC genotype is associated with less pronounced disturbances in lipid metabolism [23] and with reduced IR [24]. In the current study, however, over 90% of the CHC patients with SVR had favorable IL-28B genotype regardless of HCV genotype (Table 3). Therefore, host factors were less likely to explain the various metabolic alterations in the G1 and G2 patients after viral clearance. The HCV core Ag is strongly associated with serum lipoviral particles [25]. However, it did not correlate with any of the pre-treatment lipid profile items. Individual variation might account for this discrepancy. This observation highlights the importance of examining the changes in the lipid profiles after SVR in the same individuals.The current study demonstrates that G2 clearance affected the lipid profile more favorably than clearing G1 HCV did. Apart from TC, LDL, TG, and Apo B, G2 HCV clearance also increased the HDL and Apo AI levels, while G1 viral clearance increased the TG/HDL ratios (Table 3). After SVR, the G1 patients had higher post-treatment TG levels and TG/HDL ratios than the G2 CHC patients. These genotype-specific impacts on metabolic profiles were even more evident after eliminating the influence of IR, as G1 but not G2 had increased post-therapeutic TG and HOMA-IR levels (Figure 1). Because high TG, low HDL levels and high TG/HDL ratios all indicate a metabolic syndrome, a cluster of cardiovascular risk factors due to IR [26], [27], the worse metabolic profile after SVR might potentially lead to higher cardiovascular risks in G1 patients, as compared with G2 patients. This distinct pattern of lipid alterations between the G1 and G2 CHC patients after SVR is particularly important in areas like Taiwan, where most HCV infections are either G1 or G2 [21], [22]. Although the reversal of hypolipidemia in patients with CHC after SVR has been documented in previous studies [20], [28]–[30], to the best our knowledge, this is the first clinical study to disclose the genotype-specific impacts from G1 and G2 HCV infection on lipid metabolism. During basic research, G2 exhibited a significantly higher HDL binding rate than G1 HCV did [31]. After SVR, the higher levels of “free” HDL relieved from the G2 relative to the G1 HCV complex may contribute to the increased HDL in the G2 patients. Whether there are any differences in the composition of HDL between the G1 and G2 patients before or after SVR requires further investigations like lipoprotein electrophoresis. Furthermore, significantly different viral load of G1 and G2 HCV might have led to different liver damage and subsequently different lipoprotein metabolism.Among cases without baseline IR, after SVR, increased HOMA-IR levels were noted but did not reach the threshold for diabetes or IR, possibly indicating negligible biological importance (Table 4). It may arise directly from a less favorable lipid rather than glucose metabolism. In contrast, among patients with baseline IR, not only HOMA-IR, but also C-peptide and HbA1c levels decreased after SVR. It was compatible with previous studies [16], [32]. Also, because IR usually decreases Apo AI and HDL levels [33], the increases in Apo AI and HDL levels in those with baseline IR might stem directly from improved glucose metabolism. Therefore, SVR seemed to give rise to favorable glucose and subsequent lipid alterations in CHC patients with baseline IR. The clinical evidence also supports the finding since a large cohort study had shown the improved cardiovascular outcomes in diabetic CHC patients after anti-HCV treatment [34].However, the patients under lipid-lowering, glucose-lowering or anti-hypertension medications were excluded in the current study. It implied that those with severe metabolic disease were not counted in the longitudinal analysis. Besides, all of the comparisons in the profiles between G1 and G2 patients were cross-sectional. A large-scale, prospective, randomized-controlled study with minimal exclusion criteria might be indicated to verify the genotype-specific metabolic alteration among those with extremely severe metabolic disease.The major limitation of the current study was the lack of biopsies to validate the hepatic steatosis and fibrosis. We used ultrasonographic finding to diagnose hepatic steatosis, which is defined as the presence of hepatic steatosis in ≥5% of hepatocytes [35]. Although ultrasonography has 60–94% sensitivity and 84–95% specificity for detecting hepatic steatosis [36], its sensitivity is reduced when <30% of the liver parenchyma is infiltrated by fat [36]. Thus, ultrasonography might underestimate the prevalence of hepatic steatosis. The real role of steatosis in the genotype-specific impacts might need further verifications using liver biopsy or magnetic resonance spectroscopy [37]. To assess hepatic fibrosis, APRI is a noninvasive alternative to liver biopsies, particularly for HCV infections [18]. Whereas an updated meta-analysis had demonstrated that APRI may be only reliable in detecting severe fibrosis [38]. No difference in the pre-treatment APRI levels were found between the G1 and G2 patients might only explain the minimal role of severe fibrosis in the genotype-specific metabolic alterations. To explore the impact of mild fibrosis, liver biopsy is still demanded.Despite the favorable lipid profile, HCV infections increase cardiovascular events and associated mortalities in large-scale studies [39], [40]. Several population-based cohort studies had shown that anti-HCV treatment is associated with improved the long-term cardiovascular outcomes in the CHC patients [34], [41]. However, reversing hypolipidemia after SVR may further the emergence of cardiovascular disease in extreme cases [42]. Whether all CHC patients benefit equally from SVR regarding cardiovascular risk must be determined. The current study demonstrated that G2 patients may benefit more than G1 patients from viral clearance in metabolic alterations, particularly in those without baseline IR. Therefore, after SVR, the follow-up protocols used to survey cardiovascular events might be individualized in CHC patients according to their viral genotype and the baseline glucose metabolism, at least within 24 weeks after completion of anti-HCV therapy."
