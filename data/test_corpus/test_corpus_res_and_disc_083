"Defective viral genomes are present in the serum of a large fraction of chronic HCV1 patients
Pre-therapy serum samples of 132 subjects selected based on the selection criteria were screened for the presence of HCV defective species. Demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients of this study are summarized in Table 1. Both genders were well represented (52.3% males) and the median age was 56 years (IQR 19.25). 30.3% of patients had moderate to severe histological activity (Grading ≥ 9) and 37.1% of them showed advanced fibrosis (Staging ≥ 4). RVR and cEVR were obtained respectively in 34.1% and 58.3% of the cohort. At the end of treatment and follow-up period, 47 subjects (35.6%) achieved SVR, while 27 experienced a viral relapse and 58 were non-responders.
For all specimen used, the long-range nested PCR amplification of viral RNA produced one or more amplicons. For several subjects, an amplicon of a smaller size than expected from the amplification of full-length HCV genome could be observed (1200–2000 bps vs. expected size of 3522 bps, Fig 1A). This result suggested that, in these patients, a fraction of the circulating viral RNA contains a large genomic deletion located between the Core and the NS3 regions. The shorter-than-expected amplicons were then isolated and subjected to DNA sequencing. The presence of HCV genomes with large genomic deletions was confirmed by nucleotide sequencing in 18.9% of the patients (25/132). Importantly, all the genomic deletions that we identified in this study maintained the original ORF, indicating the potential to support translation from the authentic initiation codon. The results of the nucleotide sequence analysis are summarized in Fig 1B. In all of the defective variants, E2 was completely deleted while E1 and p7 were at least partially missing; the initial portion of NS2 was lost in 21/25 defective genomes (84%). Double deletions in a single genome were observed in 3 patients, in which a small residual fragment ranging from 28 to 43 bps was localized between the two large deletions (Fig 1B, samples 172, 114, 180). 10.1371/journal.pone.0138546.g001

FL: full-length RNA only (lane 1); D: deleted RNA only (lane 2). Lane M: molecular size markers. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of our screening assay to the presence of defective genomes, the protocol was evaluated using synthetic HCV RNA mixtures assessing full-length/defective ratios ranging from 1 to 1000 (Fig 1C). As expected, the shorter, defective specie is amplified more efficiently and is detected as the most intense band for full-length/defective ratios ranging from 1 to 10. The amplicon corresponding to the deleted genome is still clearly detectable when it represents only the 0.1% of the total HCV RNA copies, thus suggesting that the non-quantitative PCR-based assay would detect as low as 0.1% of deleted HCV genome in a sample with intermediate viremia (see also Materials and Methods).
The results obtained by the nested PCR screening described above provide a qualitative result, indicating the presence of defective form with high sensitivity; however, due to the preferential amplification of the shorter form, it does not give information on the quantity of the full-length versus the defective form. To address this point, a subset of patients who carried defective form were subjected to quantitative detection of HCV genomes by real-time PCR. In each sample, the total HCV was measured using a primer-probe set matching the 5’UTR region of the viral genome, that is conserved across samples and maintained also in defective genomes. The defective form was estimated using a primer-probe set designed specifically for each patient on the unique junction region identified from sequencing of the clone. The results are summarized in Table 2. 10.1371/journal.pone.0138546.t002

70.1% Briefly, the abundance of the defective form compared to total HCV is very heterogeneous in the subset of analyzed patients, spanning from about 4% to about 70%. In 2 out of 6 patients, the defective form is more than 50% of total HCV, indicating that deleted genomes may represent an important part of circulating HCV. The presence of HCV defective genomes is associated with patient older age, higher viral load and liver necroinflammatory activity
We next examined the correlation between the presence of defective HCV forms and clinical characteristics in the study cohort. As illustrated in Table 1, by univariate analysis, the presence of HCV defective genomes was found to be significantly associated with patient older age (Wilcoxon test Pval 0.0367), higher viral load (Wilcoxon test Pval 0.0046) and with mild to severe hepatic necroinflammatory activity (histological activity index ≥ 9; Fisher’s test Pval 0.003). Analyzing viral kinetics during PEG-IFNα/RBV treatment, we could not detect substantial differences in the decline of viral load at early time-points (RVR and cEVR rates) in carriers of HCV deleted variants; also ETR percentages were unchanged. SVR rates were lower for patients with defective genomes (24% compared to 38.3%), but the difference was not found to be statistically significant (Fisher test Pval 0.247, Fig 2A). Notably, however, among 74 patients who were HCV RNA-negative at the end of the treatment, virological relapse was observed in 60% (9/15) of the subjects carrying HCV defective genomes compared to 30% (18/59) of those infected with only the full-length virus (Fig 2B). The potential association between virological relapse and the presence of HCV defective genomes is characterized by a strong odds ratio (OR 3.35) but displayed no statistical significance by univariable analysis (Chi-test Pval 0.034, Fisher’s test Pval 0.069). This association, however, was found to be significant in a multivariate analysis that included the effect of patient IL28B genotype (see below). 10.1371/journal.pone.0138546.g002
Fig 2 Virogical responses to PEG-IFNα/RBV stratified for HCV defective forms or IL28B genotype.
RVR, EVR, ETR and SVR rates in the overall population as well as relapse rates in ETR-positive subjects, according to the presence of HCV deletions (A-B) or IL28B genotype (C-D), are reported. The presence of HCV defective particles does not have a significant effect on RVR, EVR, ETR or SVR rates, while it correlates with a higher probability of relapse in ETR-positive subjects (A-B). IL28B CT/TT genotypes are significantly associated with lower RVR, EVR, ETR and SVR rates and correlate with a higher probability of relapse (C-D). IL28B genotype profoundly influences on-treatment viral kinetics and SVR
IL28B genotype has recently emerged as a strong predictor for viral clearance in HCV1 patients undergoing PEG-IFNα/RBV therapy. Therefore, to better elucidate a possible role of HCV defective variants in influencing treatment outcome, it was essential to also take into account the well-established effect of IL28B genotype. For this reason, rs12979860 SNP genotype was determined in all the subjects of the study cohort. IL28B (rs12979860) genotype frequencies in HCV1 population were 42.4% CC, 28% CT and 29.6% TT; therefore, 57.6% of the subjects were carriers of the “non-responder” T allele. The relationships between IL28B genotype and clinical characteristics and viral kinetics are listed in Table 1. IL28B unfavorable genotype resulted associated with lower alanine transaminase (ALT) and higher gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) pre-therapy levels (Wilcoxon test pval 0.0133 and 0.0316 respectively). Moreover, a weak association (Fisher’s test Pval 0.059) was noticeable between IL28B unfavorable genotype and the lower inflammation grading scores (not shown). As expected, IL28B unfavorable genotype strongly correlated with poorer initial response to antiviral therapy (RVR and cEVR rates, Fig 2C and 2D) as well as with treatment failure (Fisher’s test Pval 3.71e-7). The association between HCV defective particles and higher histological grading is independent from IL28B genotype and viremia
In order to confirm the correlation between increased necroinflammatory activity and the presence of HCV defective particles by also taking into account the possible role of IL28B genotype and other confounding factors, a stepwise multivariable logistic regression model was exploited. The stepwise algorithm, considering high necroinflammatory activity (grading ≥ 9) as dichotomous outcome, inserts and deletes explanatory variables in an iterative process in order to select (on the basis of the minimum AIC) the best model comprising the explanatory variables independently associated with the outcome. The variables considered as input for the selection process were: patient age, viral load, gender, BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2, IL28B genotype, presence of HCV defective variants. In the stepwise procedure, viral load, among other variables, was not found to be associated with grading score and therefore was not included in the model.
As shown in Table 3, the final model resulting from the stepwise procedure confirmed the role of HCV deletions (Pval 0.028, OR 2.89), along with patient age, as risk factors for higher grading index, while IL28B genotype had a modest effect (Pval 0.079, OR 0.48 for the CT/TT variants). 10.1371/journal.pone.0138546.t003

Using the same approach, we employed a multivariable logistic regression model to pinpoint the parameters associated with viral clearance at the end of treatment (ETR). Input explanatory variables for the stepwise procedure were: age, gender, viral load, BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2, ALT, GGT, IL28B genotype, grading ≥ 9, staging ≥ 4 (or cirrhosis), presence of HCV defective variants. In the final model selected by the procedure, summarized in Table 3, IL28B CC genotype was the variable most strongly and positively associated with ETR (Pval 3.95e-7, OR 0.06 for CT/TT variants, corresponding to an OR of 16.6 for CC genotype). Patient younger age, lower pre-treatment viral load and lower GGT levels also resulted significantly associated with ETR. The presence of defective HCV particles was not selected as covariate in the model by stepwise procedure, thus suggesting that it has no impact on ETR.
Similarly, a model was constructed to evaluate the explanatory variables predicting virological relapse in the 74 subjects who where HCV-negative at the end of treatment. As described in Table 3, the presence of deletions in HCV genome represented a risk factor for relapse with an OR of 3.73 (Pval 0.049), along with mild-to-severe histological grading (OR 4.11, Pval 0.017) and IL28B CT/TT genotypes (OR 3.90, Pval 0.021).
In this study, we analyzed the presence of viral defective forms in serum samples obtained from a well-characterized cohort of patients chronically infected with genotype 1 HCV. Our screening campaign, designed to detect deletion events occurring in the region of Core to NS3, revealed the presence of virus carrying large in-frame genomic deletions, located in the E1-NS2 region, in about 20% of examined sera. Our findings are in line with previously published results and highlight that all the defective genomes contain the genomic regions essential for autonomous HCV RNA replication (5′UTR and NS2-NS5-3′UTR). In addition, the Core region appears to be always preserved [3–7]. The finding that the Core region is always present in the HCV subgenomes described here could suggest that this protein is required in cis for efficient genome encapsidation. In a study by Steinmann et al. [17], however, the authors observed that, in cell culture, subgenomic JFH1 replicons lacking the Core to NS2 coding region could be efficiently encapsidated into infectious virus-like particles. These data suggest that Core can also be effectively provided in trans. This apparent discrepancy could be due to different encapsidation requirements in vivo compared to the cell culture system. Alternatively, the Core protein, in addition to encapsidating the viral genome, could have additional important, yet unknown functions that are more advantageously carried out in cis. Future research is required to address the exact nature of this phenomenon.To our knowledge, this is the first systematic analysis carried out in a large panel of samples from well-characterized patients, and it permits to infer that the emergence of HCV deletion mutants as a circulating species, far from being a sporadic phenomenon, occurs in a relevant portion of chronically infected subjects. Furthermore, quantitative analysis carried out in a subset of patients revealed that deleted genomes are a relevant fraction of total circulating HCV.Defective interfering viral forms have been reported for a variety of viruses and their clinical impact is variable [18]. As consequence of DI virus insurgence, a reduction in the titres of the parental virus [19] and attenuation of disease severity [20] have been reported; on the other hand, it has been proposed that DI viruses may play a role in the establishment and maintenance of persistent infection, as described for Murray Valley Encephalitis Virus and Japanese Encephalitis Virus [12,21]. Moreover, a crucial pathogenic role has been established for some DI viruses belonging to the Flaviviridae family. In the case of BVDV, a highly cytopathogenic viral isolate was shown to contain a DI virus lacking the genes encoding the structural proteins [11]. In fact, the pathogenesis of lethal mucosa disease in animals persistently infected with non-cytopathogenic BVDV has been ascribed to the insurgence of cytopathogenic variants containing genomic rearrangements, among which internal deletions [22]. Similarly, cytopathogenicity of CSFV was demonstrated to be associated with a DI variant lacking the structural protein-coding region [23].Regarding HCV, the ability of defective interfering viruses to influence the clinical course of the disease is largely unexplored. Focusing on the clinical characteristics of our cohort, we observed that the presence of HCV defective variants correlates with higher viral load, older patient age and higher degree of hepatic inflammation. Since defective viruses are believed to generate from the wt genome through polymerase errors, the probability of their insurgence increases proportionally with the number of replication events. This may be at the basis of the association with patient older age (which could be considered as a proxy of the duration of infection) and higher viremia. From an etiopathological point of view, the association with necroinflammatory grading raises the possibility that HCV deletion mutants exacerbate liver inflammation. Given their high replication fitness and inability to autonomously exit from the cell, deleted variants are likely more prone to lead to the accumulation of pro-inflammatory viral proteins. Since the presence of an intact Core is one of the hallmarks of defective HCV genomes, it is conceivable that cells infected with subgenomic HCV will accumulate very high level of intracellular Core protein that, in contrast to the case of cells infected with the wt virus, will not be counterbalanced by the exit of mature viral particles. Overexpression of intracellular Core has been reported to induce the production for free radicals, oxidative stress and apoptotic cell death [24]. Moreover, Core protein has been indicated to be involved in liver steatosis, fibrosis and carcinogenesis in various mouse model systems [25].Altered expression of other viral proteins may also negatively impact the hepatocyte function. In particular, the fusion protein produced by the deletion event may be able to exacerbate the pathological changes in the cell. Induction of ER stress has been reported in both in vitro models of HCV and biopsies of HCV patients [26]; since fusion proteins are probably more prone to be unfolded or misfolded, it could be speculated that ER stress is intensified in patients carriers of defective variants. A growing body of evidence in fact suggests that ER stress and the inflammatory response are strictly interconnected [27].We did not observe a correlation between the presence of defective interfering forms and the stage of liver fibrosis. However, it should be considered that, for this cohort, the lack of knowledge of the time of infection and time of insurgence of the defective variants prevented us to correctly estimate the fibrosis progression rate and thus properly assess the impact of subgenomic HCV RNAs.We then evaluated the viral kinetics during “classical” PEG-IFNα/RBV therapy treatment in genotype 1 HCV patients carrying the defective forms compared to those in which only the full-length form was detected. No difference was found in RVR, cEVR and ETR rates, thus indicating that defective particles do not seem to play a key role in determining viral load decline during treatment. This result was confirmed also by logistic regression analysis, in which IL28B genotype, patient age, pre-treatment viremia and GGT levels, but not the presence of defective HCV, were identified as independent predictors of ETR. Interestingly, SVR rates tended to be lower for patients with defective genomes (24% compared to 38.3%), but the difference was not found to be statistically significant. Refining the analysis on the ETR-positive population, however, we observed that defective particle carriers displayed a higher probability to experience virological relapse during the follow-up period. This result is particularly interesting, since in vitro experiments suggest that defective viruses belonging to the Flaviviridae family may play a role in the establishment and maintenance of chronic infections [12,21]. A possible role in viral persistence has been suggested also for deleted variants of hepatitis B virus (HBV). Deletions in the surface antigen regions S1 and S2 of HBV genome have been reported in sera and liver of HBV patients [28,29]. For HBV, since pre-S region contains several epitopes for T or B cells [30], the emergence of deleted variants may result in an impairment of viral clearance and therefore potentially be a mechanism of evasion of immune surveillance. Notably, HCV particles carrying defective genomes have the potential to function as”immunological decoys” capable of diverting the immune responses away from the wild type virus. This mechanism could in turn favour viral persistence and impair viral clearance.Multivariable analysis confirmed the potential role of subgenomic HCV as independent risk factor for relapse, with an effect magnitude (OR 3.73) comparable to that of IL28B genotype (OR 3.90). Although this might suggest contributions of both the IL28B genotype and HCV defective forms in determining the pattern of response to PEG-IFNα/RBV treatment, we acknowledge that external, independent validation of our data would be necessary to confirm our findings.Our study indicated that, in pre-treatment sera of chronic genotype 1 hepatitis C patients, HCV particles with large in frame-deletions in E1-NS2 region are detected in about 20% of the subjects and correlate with older patient age, higher viral load and with a higher degree of liver necro-inflammation measured by the Ishak score. Regarding the response to therapy, although it did not significantly impact the SVR rate, the presence of defective HCV genomes was more frequently observed in subject experiencing a viral relapse after “classical” PEG-IFNα/RBV therapy.While the observation of the potential association with virological relapse to PEG-IFNα/RBV could represent a biologically interesting finding, it is not likely to have any practical impact in a time where relatively short therapeutic course of IFN-free, all oral combinations of direct-acting antivirals (DAA) cure nearly 100% of patients, at least for genotype 1 [31]. It is important to bear in mind, however, the recent unexpected data on decreased effectiveness of even the most advanced DAA combinations on genotype 3 infections, which represents about 10–15% of the world HCV reservoir and is associated with severe liver steatosis, accelerated fibrosis progression rate and increased oncogenesis [32].In conclusion, our study provides new important insights in the neglected field of HCV defective variants, giving detailed information about their structure, frequency and impact on clinical characteristics. It will be very important for future studies to address the occurrence of HCV with defective genomes in other viral genotypes—especially genotype 3—and the potential association with liver diseases severity as well as response to DAA therapy."
