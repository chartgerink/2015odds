HCV Viral Decline According to Treatment Group HCV viral decline of patients given the lower dose treatment was less than for those in the SDG, at weeks 2 and 4 after start of treatment, although not at week 1 (week 1∶1.72±0.74 log10 IU/mL versus 1.78±0.67 log10 IU/mL, p = 0.827; week 2∶2.3±0.89 log10 IU/mL versus 3.01±1.02 log10 IU/mL, p = 0.013; week 4∶3.52±1.2 log10 IU/mL versus 4.09±1.1 log10 IU/mL, p = 0.005) (Figure 1). The multivariate linear regression models of factors associated with HCV viral decline at weeks 1, 2 and 4 showed that the steeper and sustained HCV viral decline from week 2 to week 4 was associated with a lower baseline HCV RNA viral load and with patients in the SDG (Table 2). IL28B-CC and HCV viral decline were not associated. 10.1371/journal.pone.0048959.g001 Figure 1 Mean HCV viral decline between baseline and weeks 1, 2 and 4 for the standard drug dose group (SDG) and the low drug dose group (LDG). 10.1371/journal.pone.0048959.t002 Table 2 Multivariate linear regression model of HCV viral decline between baseline and weeks 1, 2 and 4 after start of treatment.

HCV Viral Decline According to Treatment Group and IL28B Genotype Among SDG patients, there were no differences of HCV viral decline by IL28B genotype at week 1 (1.82±0.91 log10 IU/mL versus 1.74±0.87 log10 IU/mL, p = 0.852), week 2 (3±1.1 log10 IU/mL versus 3.08±1.09 log10 IU/mL, p = 0.807) or week 4 (4.14±0.84 log10 IU/mL versus 4.17±1.06 log10 IU/mL, p = 0.938) (Figure 2A). Similarly, no differences of HCV viral decline by IL28B genotype were found among LDG patients at week 1 (2.07±0.47 log10 IU/mL versus 1.42±1.08 log10 IU/mL, p = 0.071), week 2 (2.46±0.86 log10 IU/mL versus 2.03±1.35 log10 IU/mL, p = 0.257) or week 4 (3.44±0.94 log10 IU/mL versus 3.26±1.01 log10 IU/mL, p = 0.573) (Figure 2B). 10.1371/journal.pone.0048959.g002 Figure 2 Mean HCV viral decline by IL28B genotype for the standard dose group (SDG) (Figure 2A) and the low-dose group (LDG) (Figure 2B). Among IL28B-CC genotype patients, HCV viral decline was greater in the SDG than in the LDG at weeks 2 and 4, but not at week 1 (week 1: p = 0.362; week 2: p = 0.051; week 4: p = 0.033). Likewise, HCV viral decline was greater among SDG patients carrying the IL28B non-CC genotype than among their LDG non-CC counterparts, at weeks 2 and 4 (week 1: p = 0.343; week 2: p = 0.034; week 4: p = 0.037). Rapid Virological Response Rate HCV viral load for 6 (5.6%) patients could not be evaluated at week 4. Of the remaining 100 patients, 66 (66%) achieved RVR: thirty-five (72.9%) in the SDG, and 31 (59.6%) in the LDG (p = 0.174). RVR rates by treatment group and IL28B genotype are shown in Table 3. 10.1371/journal.pone.0048959.t003 Table 3 Rapid virological response (RVR) rate by treatment group and IL28B genotype.

In our study, HCV viral decay of patients who received low-dose Peg-IFN/RBV treatment was less during the first weeks of treatment than for those receiving the standard Peg-IFN/RBV dose. This finding suggests that a lower Peg-IFN/RBV dose has less antiviral activity than the standard dose.High viral decline during the first weeks of treatment leads to a high RVR rate [3]. Several factors have been identified as determining HCV viral decay [3], [21]. Our study found that HCV viral decay correlated with Peg-IFN dose in HIV/HCV genotype 3 co-infected patients, with steeper viral decline from week 2 to week 4 in the SDG compared to the LDG. Our study also found that the dose of Peg-IFN administered during treatment was the most important factor affecting HCV viral decline in these patients. RVR rates in our study were also higher in the SDG compared to the LDG (72.9% versus 59.6%), although the differences between the two groups were not statistically significant. This point should be interpreted with caution, since a better powered cohort might be required for statistically significant associations, due to the high RVR rate among HCV genotype 3 patients.Reducing the dose in drug-based HCV therapy for monoinfected HCV genotype 3 patients has been studied in various clinical trials. Firstly, reducing the dose of Peg-IFNα2a from 180 µg/per week to 135 µg/per week was shown to give similar RVR and SVR rates [9], [10]. Secondly, SVR rates did not differ significantly according to whether a lower daily dose or a weight-adjusted dose of ribavirin was used [22]–[24]. A reduced dose of both drugs is, therefore, applicable to this patient population.However, in HCV genotype 3 patients co-infected with HIV, a low-dose Peg-IFN/RBV combination would have a considerable impact, in terms of a high SVR, greater cost savings and fewer adverse events than the standard dose. A previous open-label, single-arm pilot clinical trial involving 58 HCV/HIV co-infected patients receiving low doses of Peg-IFN/RBV found that SVR rates were 58.3% based on intention-to-treat [20]. The main limitation of this study was the fact that it was not randomized but a single-arm study whose results were compared with those observed in earlier clinical trials The results of the pilot study suggested that a lower Peg-IFN/RBV dose might be as effective as the standard dose, so supporting the design of a randomized controlled trial. There are no data however about the efficacy or safety of standard Peg-IFN/RBV dose compared to a lower-than standard dose.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to compare the efficacy of HCV viral clearance using low-dose and standard-dose drug therapy in HIV/HCV co-infected patients in the first weeks after treatment starts. Our findings suggest that the antiviral activity of the lower Peg-IFN/RBV dose is weaker than with the standard dose, which does not support equating the two for HIV/HCV co-infected patients. Our results also suggest that HCV viral decline during the first weeks of treatment would be dose-dependent, although the mechanism responsible for the difference is unknown.In our study, we found no relation between IL28B genotype and viral decline in either of the regimens evaluated. The positive effect on treatment response associated with the IL28B-CC genotype has only been observed in patients bearing genotype 1/4 [25], [26]. In fact, a previous study developed by our group reported that variations in IL28B do not have a positive impact on HCV viral decline in the first weeks after start of therapy using a standard drug dose [3]. Nor did IL28B-CC have a positive effect on RVR or SVR at standard or low drug doses in patients bearing genotype 3 [20], [25].Our study has several limitations. Firstly, our study is not a randomized clinical trial, and the presence of significant bias cannot therefore be ruled out. Secondly, due to the higher RVR rate in HCV genotype 2/3 patients, our study did not have the statistical power to detect differences in RVR rate by drug treatment dose. Thirdly, our study looked at the impact of IL28B by determining only SNP rs12979860, although the impact observed for this is not expected to be different from the other known IL28B SNP (rs8099917).In conclusion, our results show that patients who received 135 µg/per week with a 800 mg/day ribavirin dose had less HCV viral decline in the first weeks after treatment started than those who received 180 µg/per week with a weight-adjusted ribavirin dose. The implications of weaker HCV viral decline in terms of treatment outcome are unknown, although it would be expected for a weaker HCV decline to lead to a lower RVR and consequently to a lower SVR. In order to resolve this point, our findings provide justification for the design of a randomized clinical trial to compare the specific efficacy endpoints of the two Peg-IFN/RBV doses in HIV/HCV co-infected patients. Until such a randomized clinical trial with these specific endpoints is conducted, therefore, clinicians should be cautious about using lower-than-standard Peg-IFN/RBV doses in HIV/HCV genotype 3 co-infected patients."
