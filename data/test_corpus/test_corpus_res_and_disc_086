"The HCV seroprevalence was conducted on 15,323 Saudi nationals. The overall anti-HCV antibodies were detected in 7.3% (1124/15323) of the examined individuals (Figure 1a). The HCV seropositive percentages over 4 years were ranged from (6.9–9.0%) in males and (5.3–8.5%) in females where non-significant variations were found between female and male seropositive percentages using t test, (P = 0.1806) (Table 1). 10.1371/journal.pone.0029781.g001 Figure 1 Seroprevalence of anti-HCV antibodies using chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay.

This finding was higher than those recorded in other previous studies in Saudi Arabia [20], [21]. Between 1992 and 2002, 63,368 blood donors were screened for anti-HCV antibodies and 0.58% were found positive [20]. In another study, a higher ratio was reported −1.7% (9/528)- and the differences in the exposure rate due to ethnic origin was recorded where the anti-HCV in non-Bedouin Saudis (living in urban areas) was greater than that in Bedouin Saudis: 4.2% (7/165) and 0.5% (2/363) respectively [21]. On the other hand, Saudi patients subjected to hemodialysis showed a very high rate of HCV infection (up to 50%) with a further increase in the rate of infection among patients with end-stage renal disease [7]. In the present study, HCV prevalence of anti-HCV antibodies in males (55.9%) was found to be higher than the prevalence in females (44.1%) (Figure 1b).HCV among acutely infected persons showed a 14–40% spontaneous recovery rate and clear viremia shortly following seroconversion while the rest of the HCV exposed individuals developed persistent infection [22], [23], [24], [25]. Chronically infected individuals possess sustained viremia usually develop persistent HCV infection. They can expect a worsening of their liver disease, potentially culminating in cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. In the current study, HCV seropositive individuals were subjected to screening for HCV RNA viral load using a Cobas AmpliPrep/Cobas TaqMan HCV assay that possesses a lower detection limit of 12 IU/ml. This assay is used for both donors and patients and has been found to be a very effective way for screening for HCV infection [26]. In some patients, the HCV-RNA level fluctuates and accordingly, HCV-RNA is undetectable. Regular follow-up of HCV-RNA is recommended at 6–12 months intervals after clearance to confirm HCV negative status [27]. Patients in the current study who became HCV-RNA negative were often re-tested 3–4 times in 12 months to confirm their clearance of the infection as recommended by Harris et al. [27]. Patients experiencing persistent HCV infection were found to comprise 51.6% (580/1124) of the total HCV exposed individuals while 48.4% (544/1124) of the HCV exposed infection cleared the infection (Table 2). There was no explanation why the infection persists in some patients and resolves spontaneously without intervention in others. Recently, host genetic variation was found to explain the heterogeneity in HCV clearance and an association between the virus clearance and the presence of a single nucleotide polymorphism (rs12979860) −3 kilobases upstream of the IL28B gene- does exist [18], [19]. The patients in that study, who showed C/C genotype, were three times more likely to clear HCV relative to those who possessed C/T and T/T genotypes [19]. The allele frequencies showed that the pattern in which the allele leading to a greater natural HCV clearance is nearly fixed throughout East Asia and also in individuals from some Arabian Gulf countries [19].Variations in genes involved in the immune response may also contribute to the ability of patients to clear the virus [19]. Conflicting results regarding the gender effect of the HCV virus clearance were recorded [28], [29]. In the current study, non-significant (P = 0.4714) differences between the ability of infected male and female patients to clear the virus (Table 2) were found. This finding agrees with those of Inoue et al. [28] but disagrees with those of Bakr et al. [29]. It is possible that interleukin 10 promoter polymorphisms (associated with rate of IL-10 production) can account for any gender disparity in HCV clearance [30].10.1371/journal.pone.0029781.t002Table 2 Percentage of HCV clearance among HCV infected population and comparison between percentage of clearance between male and females infected patients. Male Female Total Number Percentage Number Percentage Number Percentage Ab+RNA− 310 49.4% 234 47.2% 544 48.4% Ab+RNA+ 318 50.6% 262 52.8% 580 51.6% Total 628 100% 496 100% 1124 100% Fisher's Exact Test revealed non-significant variation (P = 0.4714). While most commercially available HCV typing assays target the 5′UTR since this region is the most highly conserved and targeted for amplification methods, it has a limited subtyping accuracy [31]. Although the preferred region for subtyping is the NS5B gene, it is not always possible to amplify this region because of primer-target mismatch. Failure in sequencing the NS5B gene has been reported by some investigators despite successive attempts to amplify cDNA with the NS5B primers [32]. It is worthwhile mentioning that all 83 samples analyzed were successfully amplified and sequenced in this study using 5′UTR.Genotype 4, followed by genotypes1a and 1b, were found to be the most common genotypes in Saudi patients, whereas genotypes 2, 3, 5 and 6 were rarely found [5], [6], [7], [8]. In the current study, 81/83 strains were found to be classified as genotype 4 while only 2/83 strains were classified as genotype 1 (Figure 2). The genotype 1 strains detected in the current study possessed guanine (G) residue at position −99 (Figure 3) while 1a strains possessed adenine (A) at that residue [33], [34]. Phylogenetic analysis of the 5′UTR showed that Saudi strains (TAIF.SA9, TAIF.SA10) were identical and showed high homology to three 1b strains from Japan (AB049090, D30613 and AF207774) (Figure 2). 10.1371/journal.pone.0029781.g002 Figure 2 Phylogenetic analysis of partial 5′UTR sequences of HCV samples. HCV prototype sequences from GenBank were included. The evolutionary history was inferred using the Neighbor-Joining (NJ) method. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted in MEGA 4.1. 10.1371/journal.pone.0029781.g003 Figure 3 Deduced nucleotide sequence of different Saudi HCV strains based on 5′UTR sequences. Ten selected strains (TAIF.SA1-10) were included. The nucleotide sequence of (TAIF.SA1) was found identical in 75/81 of the examined strains. Among the genotype 4 strains in this study (n:81), different variants (TAIF.SA1-8) were found. The nucleotide sequence of one variant (TAIF.SA1) was found dominant in 75/81 of the examined strains (data not shown). This sequence was detected in both males and females with an age range of 14–70 years. This variant (TAIF.SA1), showed high homology to isolates: Eg3 (Accession No. DQ988074), RG309 (Accession No.DQ284960) and QC27 (Accession No. HCU33432) from Egypt, India and Canada, respectively. The remaining variants (TAIF.SA2-8) showed minor nucleotide variations. TAIF.SA3 and TAIF.SA7 were found closely related to TAIF.SA1. TAIF.SA4 and TAIF.SA6 were found to be identical and both showed high homology to TAIF.SA5 and to isolates: T63-UTR (Accession No. AB550032), 6 (Accession No. DQ073340), MOR69 (Accession No. HQ833265) and 42179 from Egypt, India, Morocco and UK, respectively. On the other hand, the TAIF.SA8 strain showed less homology to other genotype 4 strains detected in the current study but showed high nucleotide homology to isolates: cl111 (Accession No. DQ295833), QC306 (Accession No. EF115704), 14050 (Accession No. AY766521) and pt91 (Accession No. AM502701) from, Egypt, Canada, UK and France, respectively.Therefore, current findings confirm the corrected prevalence of HCV-4 in Saudi Arabia to be at least 97.6%, i.e. greater than the previously reported prevalence observed among the Saudi population. Further, it was found that most of Saudi patients infected with a single subtype of HCV-4 however genetic variability does exist. This suggests a recent circulation of a single HCV-4 strain among Saudi patients."
