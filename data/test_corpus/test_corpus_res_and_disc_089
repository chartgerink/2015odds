"Patient profiles and treatment response
Among the 130 patients, 62 (48%) achieved SVR, 36 (28%) relapsed, and six (5%) and 26 (20%) showed partial and null response, respectively. Patients were divided into an SVR/relapser group and a null/partial responder group. Table S1 compares the baseline characteristics of the two groups. Patients with elevated serum gamma glutamyl transpeptidase and decreased albumin concentrations were more likely to experience a null/partial response. The IL28B rs8099917 TG and rs12979860 CT variants were more likely to be null/partial responders compared with TT and CC genotypes, respectively. mRNAs associated with treatment response
mRNA microarray data were deposited into the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/), accession number GSE42697. The cut-off criteria for fold change >1.5 and p<0.003 identified 39 up-regulated and 17 down-regulated annotated probe sets in null responders (Data S1). The up-regulated genes were associated with transcription, translation, cell cycle, phosphorylation, signal transduction, immune response, RNA splicing/mRNA processing, and viral reproduction. The down-regulated genes were associated with xenobiotic/small molecule/lipid metabolic and oxidation–reduction processes. Hierarchical clustering of mRNAs and samples showed that samples from SVRs and relapsers clustered to form a group different from the null responders (Fig. S1). To validate the microarray results, qPCR was performed for all significant differentially expressed genes. The expression levels of MAP3K8 (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 8, p = 5.24×10−7), TMEM178 (transmembrane protein 178, p = 7.31×10−6), PSME4 (proteasome activator subunit 4, also known as PA200, p = 2.43×10−4), and EIF3B (eukaryotic translation initiation factor-3B, p = 3.16×10−6; Fig. 1) were significantly increased in null/partial responders compared with those in SVRs/relapsers. TMEM178 is a multi-pass membrane protein and PSME4 is a nuclear protein that activates the proteasome and is important for oxidative-stress adaptation. EIF3B is involved in protein translation/synthesis and interacts with the HCV IRES and the 40S ribosomal subunit.

The expression levels of four mRNAs were significantly higher in null/partial responders than in SVRs/relapsers. Assays for each sample were performed in triplicate. All p-values were calculated using the Mann–Whitney test. miRNAs associated with treatment response
miRNA microarray data were deposited into the NCBI GEO, accession number GSE45179. The cut-off criteria for fold change >1.2 and p<0.005 identified 111 down-regulated and 76 up-regulated miRNAs in null responders (Data S2). Hierarchical two-dimensional clustering showed that distinct patient groups clustered into two distinct groups (Fig. S2). Bioinformatic analysis predicted target genes of the differentially expressed miRNAs. The hypothetical target genes should be MAP3K8, TMEM178, PSME4, and EIF3B. Furthermore, these miRNAs and mRNAs must have an inverse correlation between mRNA and miRNA microarray data. The microRNAs that satisfied the requirements were as follows: hsa-let-7g* and hsa-miR-17-5p, -20b, -297, -374b, -494, -602, -668, and -1297 for MAP3K8; hsa-miR-106b* and -122-5p for TMEM178; and hsa-miR-492 and -675-5p for PSME4. No corresponding miRNA was identified for EIF3B. Stem-loop-based qPCR was performed to confirm the reliability of the miRNA microarray results and the inverse correlation between miRNA and mRNA. The expression levels of hsa-miR-122-5p (p = 2.75×10−8), hsa-miR-675-5p (p = 1.00×10−5), and hsa-miR-17-5p (p = 1.73×10−8) were significantly lower in null/partial responders than in SVRs/relapsers (Fig. 2).

The expression levels of three miRNAs were significantly higher in null/partial responders than in SVRs/relapsers. Assays for each sample were performed in triplicate. All p-values were calculated using the Mann–Whitney test. Independent variables associated with treatment response
Multiple logistic regression analysis of variables that were significant in univariate analysis identified that rs8099917 [p = 3.67×10−3, odds ratio (OR) = 7.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.14–29.27], hsa-miR-122-5p (p = 5.60×10−4, OR = 0.11, 95% CI = 0.03–0.38), hsa-miR-17-5p (p = 2.02×10−4, OR = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.41–0.76), and MAP3K8 (p = 8.58×10−3, OR = 2.86, 95% CI = 1.31–6.25) were significantly associated with null/partial response. Importantly, in silico analysis and microarray data suggested that increased miR-17-5p could cause MAP3K8 reduction. In fact, an inverse correlation was observed between MAP3K8 mRNA and miR-17-5p (r = −0.592, p = 4.31×10−3). MAP3K8 is closely linked to genes associated with cell proliferation, inflammation, and apoptosis (Fig. S3) and is associated with the miR-17 cluster family (Fig. S4). MAP3K8 contributes to HCV production
siRNA transfection in HCVcc-infected cells was performed to assess the influence of MAP3K8 mRNA and protein on HCV production (Fig. 3A). miR-17-5p levels were significantly increased (Fig. 3B) while supernatant HCV core antigen levels were significantly decreased following transfection of the siRNAs (Fig. 3C). However, the HCV core antigen levels in cell lysates were not changed (Fig. 3C). Taken together, these findings suggested that MAP3K8 repressed miR-17-5p and contributed to the production (e.g. release and assembly) of HCV. In vivo, MAP3K8 protein expression levels were significantly increased in null/partial responders compared with those in SVRs/relapsers (p = 2.43×10−5).

Changes in MAP3K8 and HCV core antigen levels were evaluated by hsa-miR-17-5p inhibition and overexpression in HCVcc-infected cells. miR-17-5p inhibition increased MAP3K8 mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 4A and 4B, left). In contrast, miR-17-5p overexpression decreased MAP3K8 mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 4A and 4B, right). Interestingly, miR-17-5p inhibition increased, whereas miR-17-5p overexpression decreased HCV core antigen levels in both supernatants and cell lysates (Fig. 4C). Taken together, these results suggested that miR-17-5p regulated the production of HCV by targeting MAP3K8 mRNA. Luciferase reporter assays showed that miR-17-5p overexpression decreased the luciferase activity of the wild-type MAP3K8 3′UTR reporter construct, whereas co-transfection with the mutant MAP3K8 3′UTR construct or mock had no effect (Fig. 5), suggesting that miR-17-5p targeted the MAP3K8 3′UTR and antagonized MAP3K8 protein expression.

This study showed close linkage between mRNA and miRNA signatures in CH-C treatment outcomes using global expression profiling analyses. To confirm the findings, this cohort was randomly divided into derivation and confirmatory groups. The derivation group results were similar to those described above and reproducible in the confirmatory group (data not shown). Subsequently, we attempted to compare our findings with registered patient data obtained from independent cohorts comprising either Asian or non-Asian subjects. However, comparisons were not possible because most mRNA or miRNA microarray studies had a small sample size, limited information, unregistered data, and/or findings that were not validated in an independent cohort [4]–[7], [11], [19]–[21]. To our knowledge, our study was the first to investigate the correlation between mRNA and miRNA in treatment response using global gene expression analysis and in vitro experiments. Such gene signature identification can improve the accuracy of treatment outcome predictions, independent of known strong predictors.Pretreatment hepatic ISG levels are higher in non-SVRs/non-relapsers than in SVRs/relapsers [4]–[7]. The poor ISG response of non-SVRs with further exogenous IFN may contribute to treatment failure [5], [6]. Because patient groups with different response categories differ in their innate IFN response to HCV infection; poor responders may have adopted a different equilibrium in their innate immune response to HCV [4], [6]. As per multivariate regression analysis, however, IL28B SNPs may diminish the significance of hepatic ISGs as treatment predictors because hepatic ISG expression is associated with IL28B SNPs [7], [19]. Conversely, hepatic ISGs were reported to be stronger predictors compared with IL28B SNPs [20]. Although our gene set enrichment analysis (data not shown) also showed that hepatic ISG expression levels were generally higher in null/partial responders than in SVRs/relapsers, the differences were not large enough to be ranked in a higher order and/or to reach statistical significance in expression profiling and validation analyses (Data S3). These variations among studies may be caused by different and heterogeneous patient characteristics, including HCV genotype, patient race, treatment response definitions, study end-points, and treatment regimens. This study analyzed patients with a homogeneous race and genotype (1b) who adhered to combination therapy and treatment for a specified duration.MAP3K8, also known as cancer Osaka thyroid (cot) [22] or tumor progression locus 2 (tpl2) [23], was originally recognized as a proto-oncogenic protein. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are innate immune sensors stimulated by specific microbial and viral components, including HCV. In vitro HCV infection directly induces TLR4 expression and activates human B cells to increase the production of IFN-β and IL-6 [24]. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from HCV-infected individuals express higher TLR4 levels compared with uninfected controls [24]. In the IKK-NF-κB pathway, certain activated TLRs, including TLR4, induce inhibition of kappa B kinase (IKK)- catalyzed phosphorylation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) p105. Nonphosphorylated NF-κB p105 forms a stable, inactive complex with MAP3K8. Subsequent ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated processing of NF-κB-p105 to NF-κB-p50 releases MAP3K8, which activates the MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK)-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway. MEK-ERK regulates the expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators that lead to the production of various cytokines and chemokines in a stimulus- and cell/receptor type-specific manner (Fig. S3, Fig. S4) [25], [26]. Indeed, MAP3K8 is an important and novel therapeutic target for inflammatory diseases [27]. MAP3K8 is involved in ERK signaling activation in hepatic Kupffer and stellate cells with being stimulated by TLR4 and TLR9, leading to ERK-dependent expression of the fibrogenic genes IL-1β and TIMP-1. Thus, MAP3K8 expression may contribute to liver fibrosis [28].In addition, this study provided a novel insight into MAP3K8, which is involved in resistance to HCV treatment. The results of experiments in this study demonstrated the importance of MAP3K8 in HCV production. MAP3K8 knockdown by siRNA altered extracellular, but not intracellular, HCV core antigen levels. This result suggests that MAP3K8 might be involved in the release or assembly of HCV, does not exclude the possibility that MAP3K8 participates in intracellular HCV core production because miR-17-5p influenced both supernatant and cell-lysate HCV core antigen levels along with MAP3K8 mRNA and protein levels. If MAP3K8 limited viral release/assembly alone, intracellular HCV core antigen would accumulate following siRNA transfection. Conversely, MAP3K8 overexpression did not affect HCV production, probably because enough MAP3K8 may exist in the cells. This result is generally observed in other critical host factors (e.g. hVAP-33) involved in the HCV life cycle [29]. The above description [24]–[26] and in silico analyses (Fig. S3, Fig. S4) suggest that MAP3K8 might play a role in HCV production through a regulatory pathway and network (Fig. S5); however, the exact mechanism remains unknown and requires further investigation. It is important to note that there may be differences between the HCV genotype 1b- and 2a-derived strains/replicons. The 2a-derived JFH1 infection system is highly competent compared with other genotype-derived systems and allows steady inhibition and expression analyses [30]. Notably, this in vitro study focused on the correlation between MAP3K8 and miR-17-5p and their impact on HCV production; there may not be significant genotypic effect on MAP3K8 and miR-17-5p. Importantly, it is difficult to determine genotype-specific differences using different infection-competent systems.The miR-17-92 polycistron, also known as the first oncomir, encodes six or seven miRNAs, including miR-17-5p [31], [32], and is frequently overexpressed in several tumors [31], [33]. In contrast, overexpression of miR-17-5p also leads to tumor suppression in breast cancer [34] and HeLa cells [32]. miR-17-5p may function as both a tumor suppressor and an oncogenic activator by targeting both pro- and anti-proliferative genes and by competing with each other in different cellular contexts, which are dependent on the expression of other transcriptional regulators [35]. Known targets of the miR-17-92 cluster primarily regulate cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and transcription factors [32], [35]. Physiologically, this cluster is down-regulated during aging, and hematopoietic and lung differentiation. During HIV infection, suppression of this cluster by the virus is required for efficient viral replication [36]. Our results suggest that inhibition of miR-17-5p expression may be advantageous for HCV production. Interestingly, miR-17-5p overexpression in HeLa cells decreases the expression of the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (LDLR) and consequently induces reduced intracellular lipoprotein accumulation because of the impaired internalization [32]. LDLR is one of putative HCV receptors; however, its precise role remains controversial [37]-[40]. LDLR also aids the optimization of HCV replication, and the expression levels are stimulated by HCV infection. Decreased LDLR and lipoprotein uptake through LDLR may adversely affect the HCV life cycle because hepatocyte lipid metabolism pathways are required for HCV.Bioinformatics and in vitro experiments showed that miR-17-5p expression levels were inversely correlated with MAP3K8 in response to anti-HCV treatment. miR-17-5p repressed HCV production by inhibiting MAP3K8 expression, whereas miR-17-5p expression was influenced by MAP3K8. The results also suggested a specific interaction between miR-17-5p and MAP3K8 3′UTR, which was previously validated by the luciferase reporter assay [35]. Taken together, MAP3K8 expression following HCV infection is negatively influenced by miR-17-5p at both the translational and transcriptional levels. This molecular interaction is a potential target for novel molecular therapeutics. However, a single miRNA can regulate the expression of multiple target mRNAs by imperfect base pairing [9], [10]. Conversely, the expression of a single mRNA may be regulated by several miRNAs. Numerous mRNAs and miRNAs are key regulators in complicated pathophysiological networks (Fig. S3, Fig. S4). Therefore, it is important to note that the complex interaction between MAP3K8 and miR-17-5p may not be reflective of a correlation between their expression and viral load in our patient cohort.Abundant hepatic miR-122 expression is essential for efficient HCV replication in cultured human hepatoma cells [11]. Suppression of miR-122 leads to a marked reduction and long-lasting suppression of HCV RNA in both sera and the livers of nonhuman primates with chronic HCV infection [41]. Paradoxically, this study showed significantly lower miRNA-122 (hsa-miR-122-5p) expression levels in null/partial responders than in SVRs/relapsers, independent of other factors. This finding is in agreement with the results of a previous study, which reported markedly low baseline miR-122 levels in poor responders [21]. Moreover, no positive correlation was observed between miR-122 expression and viral load. No convincing explanation exists for these paradoxical results. Re-analysis of registered miRNA microarray data [8] identified significantly low miR-122 levels, no change in miR-675-5p levels, and low (although not significant) miR-17-5p levels in null/partial responders. Most miR-122 target genes are involved in the lipid biogenesis pathway [42], and miR-122 antagonism induces a substantial decrease in plasma lipid levels. As described above, host lipid metabolism is vital to HCV [40], and may be related to the endogenous IFN response to HCV and IL28B SNPs [43]. However, we did not find a correlation between miR-122 expression and serum lipid levels nor identify miR-122 target genes, including lipid-related metabolic pathways, which could be considered key molecular signatures contributing to a null/partial response.In conclusion, both global mRNA and miRNA expression profiling analyses increase our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie refractory treatment responses and are even applicable to next-generation treatment. The results obtained in this study also aid the identification of novel features of known genes and target molecules for future therapeutic intervention."
