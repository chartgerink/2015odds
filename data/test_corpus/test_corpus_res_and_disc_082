"A total of 267 patients were included in the cohort of patients treated with Peg-IFN and RBV. Premature discontinuation of the therapy because of adverse events occurred in 11 (4%) patients. RVR, ETR and SVR were observed in 55 (21%), 144 (54%) and 113 patients (42%), respectively. Relapses occurred in 31 individuals, representing 21% of the 144 patients with ETR. Distribution of the diverse types of response as a function of HCV genotypes is shown in Table 1.

Response to anti-HCV therapy in HIV-infected patients coinfected by HCV genotype 1
Patients infected by HCV genotype 1 (n = 187) showed a SVR in 39% (n = 73) of cases. The SVR rate was significantly higher in patients harboring IL28B genotype CC, in those with HCV-RNA levels <600000 IU/ml and in those with non-significant liver fibrosis. The percentage of patients with SVR was also significantly higher among individuals with RVR (Table 2). The positive predictive value (PPV) of SVR after attainment of RVR was 96%.
When only the baseline parameters were considered (excluding the presence or absence of RVR), the best logistic regression analysis model demonstrated that the baseline characteristics which independently influenced SVR were IL28B genotype CC [Exp(B) 3.30; 95%CI, 1.74–6.25, p<0.001], plasma HCV-RNA levels <600000 IU/ml [Exp(B) 2.56; 95%CI, 1.26–5.20, p = 0.009] and the absence of significant liver fibrosis [Exp(B) 2.15; 95%CI, 1.14–4.05, p = 0.019]. Combining these factors, the probability of a SVR after Peg-IFN and RBV therapy is shown in Figure 1.

Because of the importance of RVR as a predictor of SVR, a separate analysis was performed to detect those factors associated with it (Table 2). A RVR was detected in 23 patients (12%). Parameters associated with RVR were IL28B genotype CC and plasma HCV-RNA levels <600000 IU/ml. In the multivariate analysis, both factors were independently associated with RVR: IL28 genotype CC [Exp(B) 2.96; 95%CI, 1.16–7.55, p = 0.023] and HCV-RNA <600000 IU/ml [Exp(B) 3.78; 95%CI, 1.51–9.43, p = 0.004]. Combining these factors, the probability of a RVR is shown in Figure 2.

One hundred and sixty four patients did not show RVR. Of these, 87 had undetectable HCV-RNA at week 12 and were programmed for treatment for 48 weeks, although therapy was discontinued in 8 of them due to adverse effects. Another 25 patients presented with a decrease >2 log10 at week 12 and undetectable HCV-RNA at week 24, and were treated for 72 weeks. Fifty one of 164 patients (31%) without RVR presented SVR (40 of these were treated for 48 weeks and 11 for 72 weeks), and this group included a significantly higher proportion of patients with IL28B genotype CC as well as a higher percentage of patients without significant liver fibrosis (Table 3). In the logistic regression model, only the absence of significant liver fibrosis was independently associated with SVR [Exp(B) 2.67; 95%CI, 1.35–5.30, p = 0.005].

Response to anti-HCV therapy in HIV-infected patients coinfected by HCV genotype 4
Next, we analyzed the probability of SVR in patients coinfected with HCV genotype 4. All of these patients were treated for 48 weeks, and a SVR was obtained in 22 cases (42%). A significantly higher percentage of these patients showed IL28B CC polymorphism and HCV-RNA <600000 IU/ml, and a lower proportion presented significant liver fibrosis (Table 2). When these parameters were associated, the probability of a SVR was that shown in Figure 1. Some 55% of patients with SVR had achieved a RVR. The PPV of a RVR was 100%.
The best logistic regression analysis model demonstrated that the independent factors associated with SVR were IL28B genotype CC [Exp(B) 23.58; 95%CI, 2.54–219.11, p = 0.005] and an HCV-RNA <600000 IU/ml [Exp(B) 4.25; 95%CI, 1.06–17.07, p = 0.042]. Response to anti-HCV therapy in HIV-infected patients coinfected by HCV genotypes 2 and 3
Lastly, we analyzed the response to anti-HCV treatment of those HIV-infected patients coinfected by HCV genotypes 2 (n = 4) and 3 (n = 23). All of these patients were treated for 48 weeks. Some 74% of patients (20 out of 27) attained a RVR. However, five of them did not show a SVR due to the development of relapses (PPV of RVR: 75%) (Table 2).
Patients with SVR showed a lower percentage of significant liver fibrosis and liver cirrhosis than those without SVR [Exp(B) 9.10, 95%CI 1.39–59.62, p = 0.021]. The remainder of the parameters did not show significant differences. Influence of TNF-α and IL-10 polymorphisms on the risk of significant fibrosis or cirrhosis
TNF-α and IL-10 polymorphisms were not associated with SVR. However, the influence of both polymorphisms on an independent prognostic factor of SVR, the presence of significant liver fibrosis or cirrhosis, had been previously demonstrated by our group [19]. Thus, we studied the influence of both polymorphisms on the presence of significant liver fibrosis or cirrhosis in this series (Table 4).

IL28B or IL-10 polymorphisms were not associated with significant fibrosis or cirrhosis. Patients with the GG genotype at position −238 in the proximal promoter of the TNF-α gene showed significantly higher values of liver stiffness and a higher proportion of liver cirrhosis than those with genotypes GA/AA. The remaining HCV- or HIV-related characteristics did not show significant differences among patients harboring the TNF-α genotype GG and those with genotypes GA/AA.
Because a successful treatment against chronic HCV infection in HIV-coinfected patients has demonstrated a decrease in liver decompensation events as well as in liver- and non-liver related mortality [23], optimization of this therapeutic strategy is a priority. This study analyzed the efficacy of Peg-IFN and RBV and the factors related to the viral response in a large series of HIV/HCV coinfected patients. A SVR was obtained in 42% of the patients, a percentage similar to that obtained in another series [24]. It should be noted that our study was performed with careful management of side effects in order to attain a low rate of discontinuation due to the toxicity of anti-HCV therapy.The variables included in our analysis have previously been shown to predict achievement of SVR, although prior attempts to model SVR by combining all these predictors of response in HIV/HCV coinfected patients are scarce [25].In patients infected by HCV genotype 1, one topic of great interest is the identification of patients with a high probability of response to Peg-IFN and RBV without requiring the inclusion of the direct-acting antivirals telaprevir, boceprevir, sofosbuvir or simeprevir in their treatment. In the particular case of HIV-infected patients, this aspect is important because the interactions with antiretroviral treatment will have to be added to the drawbacks of the new protease inhibitors, along with a higher rate of adverse events and the cost of treating HIV/HCV coinfected patients, which could render universal therapy unaffordable for public health systems [3], [16], [26], [27]. In our study, 39% of HIV-infected patients coinfected by HCV genotype 1 achieved a SVR, similar to other series [10], [15], [24], [28], [29], [30]. One parameter with a high influence on attaining a SVR was the achievement of a RVR: the probability of SVR among patients with RVR was 96%. In HIV/HCV coinfected patients, positive predictive values higher than 75% for HCV genotype 1 have been reported for subjects achieving RVR while receiving therapy [24], [30], [31].The baseline parameters independently associated with a RVR in HIV-infected patients coinfected by HCV genotype 1 were an IL28B CC genotype and a HCV-RNA <600000 IU/ml. The beneficial impact of the IL28B CC genotype on HCV viral clearance is due to a greater and more rapid HCV viral decline in the first weeks following start of treatment with Peg-IFN plus RBV [31], [32], [33]. In a clinical trial including treatment-naïve, HCV monoinfected patients, subjects carrying the favorable IL28B genotype showed similar rates of SVR, regardless of receiving Peg-IFN and RBV plus boceprevir or placebo (81% vs. 78%, respectively) [33].It has been proven that the impact of IL28B genotype on the probability of SVR depends on a number of concomitant predictive factors, such as plasma HCV-RNA levels [10], [25], [29], [34]. HCV-RNA levels significantly modify the association between the favorable IL28B genotype and a SVR to Peg-IFN plus RBV in patients infected with HCV genotype 1. Thus, among patients infected by HCV genotype 1 harboring the IL28B genotype CC, 71% of individuals with HCV-RNA <600000 IU/l reached a SVR vs 49% of those with a higher HCV load.The third independent factor associated with a SVR was the absence of significant liver fibrosis. Explanations about the influence of liver fibrosis are varied: 1) the influence of liver fibrosis could be attributed to the higher number of secondary effects detected in these patients [10], [25]; 2) an alternative explanation is that lower percentages of HCV infected hepatocytes and hepatocyte infection rate are predictors of SVR [35]. Interestingly, the absence of significant liver fibrosis was a predictive parameter of SVR mainly in those patients without RVR. This has a practical consequence: when RVR is used to identify patients to be treated only with Peg-IFN and RBV, the presence or absence of significant liver fibrosis is not a definitive factor in the decision between dual (only Peg-IFN plus RBV) or triple therapy (adding telaprevir or boceprevir).According to these data, a suitable management strategy for HCV genotype 1 infected patients with IL28B genotype CC and HCV-RNA lower than 600000 IU/ml would be to start a 4-week lead-in phase with Peg-IFN plus RBV followed by the addition or not of boceprevir [36] or telaprevir [37], depending on RVR. This suggestion would need to be studied prospectively.Another factor to be considered in the parameters associated with a low SVR is the higher rate of relapse after completing a course of therapy. Effectively, a higher relapse rate after completing a course of therapy could contribute to a lower SVR in this population [38]. Relapses were detected in 24 patients (13% of the total population, 21% of those with ETR), within the range seen in other series of coinfected patients treated with Peg-IFN plus RBV (range: 15%–37% of those with ETR) [38], [39]. Relapses were especially present in those individuals without a RVR (only one patient with RVR experienced relapse after suppression of anti-HCV therapy). Among those without RVR, a higher percentage of patients with significant liver fibrosis (higher than 90% of the patients) was demonstrated in patients with relapses, suggesting a role of liver fibrosis in the incidence of relapses and, consequently, in the decreased probability of SVR.Our study also analyzed the response of HIV-infected patients coinfected by other HCV genotypes. To date, few specific data are available on the treatment of HIV-infected patients coinfected by HCV genotype 4. A previous study by our group showed a SVR of 31% in a series of HIV-infected patients coinfected by HCV genotype 4, with the IL28B genotype being the sole independent prognostic factor of response to Peg-IFN and RBV [11]. In the present study, a SVR was attained in 42% of patients. In our series, patients harboring the IL28B CC genotype and with HCV-RNA levels <600000 IU/l showed a SVR in 100% of cases, although the percentage of patients with both favorable parameters only accounted for 15% of those treated. The probability of response in those with an IL28B CT or TT genotype is very low, especially in those with a higher HCV viral load: those with an IL28B CT/TT genotype and HCV-RNA levels >600000 IU/l showed a SVR in only 17% of cases. Another interesting finding was the importance of achieving a RVR in this group of patients: all patients with a RVR showed a SVR. Liver fibrosis was not an independent parameter with an influence on SVR.In patients with HCV genotype 2 or 3 coinfection, a SVR was attained in 67% of individuals, a percentage inferior to that observed in other series [24], [39], [40], [41], [42]. The main reason for this result was the percentage of relapses among patients with an ETR. A high proportion of relapses has been observed previously in patients infected by HCV genotype 3 [38], [43], [44]. This has been attributed either to insufficient doses of RBV or to a short duration of treatment (24 weeks) when a RVR had not been achieved [38]. However, in our series, a weight-adjusted dose of RBV was administered and all patients were treated for 48 weeks. Moreover, a RVR had been obtained in 74% of individuals. Infection by HCV genotypes 2 or 3 is a particular case in which the achievement of a RVR is not a good predictor of absence of relapses or of SVR. RVR has obtained a significantly higher PPV of SVR in other series of HIV/HCV patients treated against HCV genotype 3 [24], [40]. The explanation for this discrepancy is probably related to the main predictive factor of relapses and SVR detected in the present study: the existence of significant liver fibrosis. In our series, liver cirrhosis was detected in 44% (12 out of 27 patients) of individuals. Although the importance of this predictive factor was lower in HIV-infected patients coinfected by HCV genotypes 1 or 4, it is evident that liver fibrosis needs to be taken into account in patients coinfected by HCV genotype 3: in these, even in patients with a RVR, a proportion of those with ETR will show higher rates of relapse. Unfortunately, this is not a modifiable factor, except by the possibility of treating patients in an early phase of the liver disease.The other parameters studied here were polymorphisms of the promoters of TNF-α and IL-10 genes. Our study confirmed that the GG genotype of the TNF-α −238 gene promoter is implicated in the probability of liver cirrhosis, supporting our previous data [19] in a different and larger sample of HIV/HCV coinfected patients. Previous data have demonstrated the impact of TNF-α on liver fibrogenesis: increased concentrations of TNF-α have been detected in the liver of patients with chronic hepatitis C [45] and it has been observed that serum levels of this cytokine are correlated with the histological grading score of hepatitis [46]. Likewise, it has been observed that patients with increased serum levels of TNF-α or its receptors showed a reduced survival rate [47]. In addition, IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine that downregulates the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, has a modulatory effect on hepatic fibrogenesis [17], [18]. Moreover, higher serum concentrations of IL-10 have been correlated with SVR after anti-HCV therapy in HCV monoinfected patients [48]. However, the usefulness of TNF-α or IL-10 polymorphisms as predictors of response to Peg-IFN-α plus RBV was not demonstrated in the present series of HIV/HCV coinfected patients.CD4 T cell counts were over 200/mm3 in the majority of patients, which limits the ability to detect an effect of immune status on the probability of SVR. Previous series [10], [24], [25] did not support an effect of immune status on SVR in HIV/HCV coinfected patients.In summary, RVR, mainly influenced by IL28B genotype and HCV-RNA levels, can reliably predict a SVR after 4 weeks of therapy with Peg-IFN plus RBV in HIV/HCV coinfected patients with HCV genotypes 1 or 4, which could contribute to reducing unnecessary adverse effects and costs, and to improving the management of these individuals. However, in patients with infection by HCV genotype 3, the elevated relapse rate compromises the influence of RVR on SVR. In patients infected by HCV genotypes 1 and 3, relapses were related to the presence of advanced liver fibrosis."
