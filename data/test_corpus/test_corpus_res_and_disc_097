"A siRNA depletion screen identifies host factors (HFs) for HSV-1 replication
Host factors (HFs) which positively or negatively regulate HSV-1 replication were identified by screening a druggable genome siRNA library (4 siRNAs per gene) targeting 7,237 human genes against a HSV-1 reporter virus expressing the enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP; HSV-1 strain C12) in the epithelial Hela cell line, due to their ease of transfection and susceptibility to HSV-1 infection [34]. To generate a robust and reliable dataset the screen was carried out three times in triplicate, with one replicate used in a cell viability assay to determine any cytotoxic effects of gene depletion and duplicates infected for the virus infection assay. The siRNA library was reverse-transfected into Hela cells before infecting with HSV-1 and monitoring virus growth kinetics as a measure of GFP-fluorescence (Figure 1b). By following virus growth over multiple rounds of replication, host proteins involved in all stages of the virus life cycle can be identified. Replication slopes during linear growth were normalized to controls (mock-transfected cells, and cells transfected with a siRNA unable to be processed by the RNA Silencing Complex, RSCF) and the mean of six replicates was calculated. siRNAs found to be cytotoxic (81 in total) were excluded from further analyses, and a hitlist of 358 containing the top 2.5% inhibitory and the top 2.5% enhancing HFs was generated (Table S1 in Text S2). The identified HSV-1 HFs were compared to datasets from published siRNA depletion screens aimed at identifying cellular factors affecting HIV-1 [7], [8], [9], West Nile Virus (WNV) [14], Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) [13], Dengue virus [15] and Influenza A virus [10], [11], [12]. Of our 358 HFs, 54 cellular proteins (15.1%) overlapped with these other virus screens (Influenza A, 29; HIV-1, 24; HCV, 6; WNV, 2; Dengue virus, 1) (Figure 1c; Table S2 in Text S2).

Identification of HSV-1 host factors by RNAi and Y2H screens.
(a) Strategy to identify host factors interacting with viral proteins or influencing HSV-1 replication. (b) RNAi perturbation screen by kinetic analysis of HSV-1 replication. Hela cells were reverse-transfected with siRNA SMARTpools (4 siRNAs per gene). After 48 h the siRNAs were tested for cytotoxicity (3 replicates) or the capacity to influence replication of the HSV-1 GFP reporter virus C12 (6 replicates) from 24 to 80 h post-infection. Virus replication slopes during the linear phase were calculated and normalized to mock-transfected cells. Replication slopes were then compared to replication upon knockdown of essential (ICP4, VP16) or non-essential (VP11/12) viral genes, a cellular receptor for HSV-1 (HVEM) or control RISC-free siRNA (RSCF).

A genome-scale yeast two-hybrid protein interaction screen identifies novel viral protein interaction partners
HSV-1 is currently known to encode at least 84 proteins, expressed sequentially under strict temporal regulation during infection. To gain further mechanistic insight into host factors involved in HSV-1 infection, in parallel to the siRNA depletion screen we carried out a yeast two-hybrid protein interaction screen to identify cellular interaction partners of viral proteins. We generated a collection of 107 partial and full-length HSV-1 cDNA constructs and tested them for interactions with proteins encoded by a library of 12,381 human cDNA clones [35]. 231 HSV-1-human protein interactions were detected once (low confidence), and 63 more than once (high-confidence)(Table S3 in Text S2). Using these high-confidence interactions, the previously reported HSV-1 interactome [36] was connected into a human interactome (62,310 published protein interactions) to generate a combined pathogen-host interactome (Figure S1a). Both degree centrality (which indicates the number of interactions a protein has, where high values represent highly interactive ‘hubs’) and betweenness centrality (which indicates the number of shortest paths between any pair of proteins passing through the protein considered) were significantly increased for HSV-1 interactors, particularly in the high-confidence network (Figure S1b–e). These data suggest HSV-1 proteins preferentially target highly connected central human proteins in the cellular interaction network, similar to other viruses [23].
Analysis of this interactome for HFs identified by RNAi found they were enriched in the fraction of cellular proteins that directly interact with viral proteins or that interact via one intermediate, in comparison to proteins that only interact via 2 or more intermediates (p = 0.036, Fisher's exact test)(Figure S1f). A direct comparison of HSV-1 protein interaction partners and the siRNA screen HFs found 215 genes in common. Of those, ten (4.6%) were identified as a hit in both screens (Table S4 in Text S2), suggesting that these technologies identify complimentary yet not necessarily overlapping HFs. Validity and specificity of HSV-1 HFs
An extended literature and database search identified 599 cellular proteins that interact with or are involved in infection with human herpesviruses. The overlap between the high-confidence Y2H cellular interactors (63) and HFs (358) with this set was statistically significant (p = 0.008) (Figure 2a; Figure S1h; Table S5 in Text S2). From this combined analysis, a subset of HFs was chosen for further validation. Protein interactions were tested in a mammalian cell system by LUMIER pull-down assay [37]. Of the 45 interactions tested, 26 (57.8%) were confirmed, with 15 strongly positive (z-score >2) and 11 weakly positive (z-score 1–2) (Figure S1g). siRNA deconvolution (4 siRNAs per gene tested individually) was used to further validate 72 HFs (Figure 2b; Figure S2). The replication phenotype could be confirmed (≥2 or more siRNAs gave the same or better replication slope than observed in the primary screen) in a high proportion (83.3%) of candidates, highlighting the reliability of the primary screen dataset. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of mRNA expression levels found a minimum depletion of 60% (mean 88%) in a subset of 52 genes (data not shown; Table S6 in Text S2) confirming the observed effects on HSV-1 replication are genuine and not due to ‘off-target’ effects or insufficient gene knockdown. To further investigate the virus-specificity of our identified HFs, we tested this subset for their effect on the replication of an additional α-herpesvirus (Varicella-Zoster virus, VZV), the β-herpesvirus Cytomegalovirus (CMV), and a completely unrelated RNA virus, Semliki Forest Virus (SFV). None of the three proteins which enhanced HSV-1 replication upon knockdown had an effect on either VZV or CMV, and one (NR3C2) was even inhibitory for SFV (Figure 2c). Of the 64 siRNAs which inhibited HSV-1, 27 (42.2%) were also inhibitory for VZV, 60 for CMV (93.8%) and 23 (35.9%) for SFV replication (Table S7 in Text S2). Some functional groups (transcriptional regulators) were required by most viruses, but there were notable differences between other proteins. For example IFITM-1, previously identified as an inhibitor of Influenza A, Dengue virus and WNV [10], inhibited VZV yet had a positive effect on HSV-1 replication. These data suggest that whilst there are some HFs which are broad in their effects on virus replication, a large proportion are species-specific.

Primary validation of HFs for HSV-1.
(a) Overlap between HSV-1 HFs, cellular protein interactors of HSV-1 proteins identified by Y2H system, and published protein interactors of all human herpesviral proteins. (b) Validation of a subset of HFs by siRNA deconvolution. A subset of HFs was selected for validation with deconvoluted siRNAs to confirm the phenotype observed in the primary screen. The effect of the four individual siRNAs (1–4) and a reconstituted SMARTpool (SP) were tested by reverse-transfecting into Hela cells before infecting after 48 h with HSV-1-eGFP (C12) and monitoring replication. Replication slopes were calculated and normalized as described, and compared to the primary screen slope (1°). A heat map of replication slopes was generated where red represents inhibition (replication slope <0.5) and green represents enhancement (slope >1). The phenotype was considered validated if ≥2 siRNAs produced the same or better phenotype as the primary screen. (c) Virus specificity of HSV-1 HFs. The effect of HF siRNA SMARTpools on the replication of VZV (α-herpesvirus), hCMV (β-herpesvirus) or Semliki Forest virus (SFV; RNA virus) was determined and compared to HSV-1. Normalized replication ±2×STDEV of the controls was considered inhibiting/enhancing. HSV-1 HFs are involved in diverse cellular pathways and at multiple stages of the HSV-1 life cycle
Functional and pathway analysis of the 358 HSV-1 HFs identified in the siRNA depletion screen (Figure S3a), and of direct and indirect virus-host interactions with multiple interaction partners (Figure S3b), found a significant enrichment of a wide range of cellular processes involved in multiple stages of virus replication (Table S8 in Text S2). Pathways included those involved in gene expression, transcription, splicing and translational regulation (RNAi screen), and protein transport, cell cycle, and transcriptional repressor activity (Y2H screen). A combined analysis of HFs from both screens found dominant functional categories centred on the regulation of transcription (RNA polymerase II-associated genes, splicing factors, transcription activation and the Mediator complex) (Figure S3c, d). The physiological relevance of some HFs and pathways was confirmed by further biological validation. Protein transport pathways (in the form of dynein microtubule networks) are exploited by HSV-1 early after infection to shuttle viral capsids to the nucleus. These screens confirmed known interactions between dynein subunits and viral proteins, and identified additional previously unknown interactions (Text S1 and Figure S4a). Several dynein chain subunits were found to be essential for virus replication, whilst the moderate effect of depletion of other subunits demonstrated a level of functional redundancy in HSV-1 capsid transport (Figure S4b–e) [38], [39]. Intrinsic anti-viral host defense mechanisms, in the context of cellular E2 ubiquitin ligases, were also investigated. The immediate-early viral protein ICP0, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, is crucial for blocking anti-viral defense mechanisms by degrading promyeloctic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies (ND10 domains) in the presence of cellular E2-ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s). Our siRNA screen found multiple E2s were required for this, and suggests that HSV-1 ICP0 is promiscuous in its exploitation of E2s to mediate PML degradation and ensure successful infection (Text S1 and Figure S5). Med23 is an anti-viral component of the pro-viral Mediator complex
Combined bioinformatic analyses of protein interaction and siRNA depletion screens found a significant functional enrichment for proteins involved in transcription, and identified multi-protein complexes enriched for pro-viral HFs which strongly inhibited HSV-1 upon depletion, including the RNA-polymerase II, eIF3 and Mediator complexes (Figure 3a). The Mediator complex links the cellular transcription machinery (RNA polymerase II) to specific transcription factors, and the identification of many Mediator subunits as HFs in other viral siRNA depletion screens highlights its significant role in viral genome transcription [7], [9], [11], [40] (Table S2 in Text S2). Further, several Mediator subunits (Med25, 29, 17 and 8) are known to interact with the HSV-1 transactivator VP16 (UL48) and other herpesviral proteins [41] (Figure S6a). Consistently, the Mediator complex was found to be strongly required for HSV-1 replication, with depletion of the majority of subunits (Med 4, 6, 7, 8, 14, 16, 17, 21, 25, 26, 27 and 28) leading to a severe reduction in virus replication in the primary screen (Figure S6b) or in confirmatory deconvolution assays (Figure 3b). However, depletion of the Med23 subunit was striking in that it led to a significant enhancement of virus growth (Figure 3b). Flow cytometry quantification found that removal of Med23 not only increased the total number of infected cells (combination of GFPlo and GFPhi cells; 75.5% in comparison to 49.6% in mock-transfected cells) but also the copy number of virus genomes (GFPhi cells; 44.8% in comparison to 24.4% in mock-transfected cells) (Figure 3c). Gain-of-function experiments found overexpression of Med23 led to a corresponding inhibition of two strains of HSV-1 (Figure 3d; Figure S6c), confirming Med23 is a natural anti-viral component of the pro-viral Mediator complex. This anti-viral effect of Med23 was specific for HSV-1, as replication of VZV (α-herpesvirus), hCMV (β-herpesvirus), Vaccinia virus (DNA) and SFV (RNA virus) remained unaffected by Med23 depletion (Figure 3e).

Arrow denotes Med23. (b) Deconvoluted siRNAs confirm role of Mediator subunits in HSV-1 replication. The effect of four individual siRNAs (1–4) and a reconstituted SMARTpool (SP) on a range of subunits of the Mediator complex were compared to the primary screen (P). Med25 was not present in the primary screen so has no comparative ‘P’. Hela cells were transfected and infected with HSV-1-eGFP. Replication slopes were calculated and normalized to controls. Error bars represent the mean of three independent experiments done in duplicate. (c) Fluorescence microscopy and FACS analysis of Hela cells depleted of Med23. Hela cells transfected with either ICP4 or Med23 siRNA SMARTpools were infected with the recombinant HSV-1 GFP reporter virus C12 (MOI 1) and analysed by fluorescence microscopy and FACS analysis. Numbers indicate the percentage of cells in the uninfected, GFPlo or GFPhi populations. (d) Overexpression of Med23 inhibits HSV-1 C12-GFP and VP26-YFP. Hela or HEK cells overexpressing Med23 transiently (Hela) or stably (HEK) were infected with HSV-1 C12-eGFP or HSV-1 VP26-YFP at MOI 0.5. Replication slopes were monitored and normalized to control (pCR3)-transfected cells. Error bars represent the mean of at least three independent experiments. (e) Depletion of Med23 specifically affects HSV-1. Hela cells were depleted for Med23 with a siRNA SMARTPool and infected with HSV-1, Varicella zoster virus (VZV), human cytomegalovirus (hCMV), Vaccinia virus (VacV) or Semliki Forest Virus (SFV). Replication slopes (HSV-1, VZV, hCMV, VacV) or endpoint replication values (SFV) were calculated and normalized to controls. Error bars represent the mean of at least three independent experiments. Med23 inhibits HSV-1 replication by inducing a type III interferon (IFN-λ) response
Med23 could exert anti-viral effects either by having an inhibitory effect on viral transactivators or by interacting with and having a positive effect on an existing anti-viral factor. We first tested whether Med23 directly affects viral gene expression using luciferase reporters with HSV-1 promoters, however observed no inhibitory effect (data not shown). Since the Mediator complex and Med23 in particular is known to be involved in Jak/Stat-mediated interferon signaling [42], we used the lung epithelial cell line A549 and its Stat-1-deficient derivative A549-V [43] to determine if Med23 influences HSV-1 replication by modulating innate immunity. In the parental A549 cells the phenotype of HSV-1 replication was the same as that observed in Hela cells, where depletion of Med23 enhanced replication and over-expression inhibited virus growth. However, in the Stat1-deficient A549-V cells HSV-1 replication was unaffected by both depletion and over-expression of Med23 (Fig. 4a), indicating that Med23 requires an intact Jak/Stat signalling pathway to exert its anti-viral effects.

Med23 inhibits HSV-1 by inducing a Type III interferon (IFN-λ) response.
(a) Med23 depletion or over-expression has no effect in A549-V cells deficient in Jak/Stat signalling. A549 cells and derivative A549-V cells were transfected with Med23 siRNA SMARTpool (Med23 KD) or a pCR3-Med23 overexpression plasmid (Med23+) 48 h (siRNA) or 24 h (pCR3) before infection with HSV-1-eGFP C12. Replication was monitored, and slopes calculated and normalized to controls (RSCF siRNA or pCR3). Error bars represent the mean of at least three independent experiments. (b) Pre-treatment with Type III interferons prevents Med23-mediated enhancement of HSV-1 replication. A549 cells were mock-transfected or transfected with Med23 siRNA. After 48 h cells were untreated or pre-treated with 50 ng/ml IFN-α, IFN-β, IFN-γ or 100 ng/ml IFN-λ1 or IFN-λ2/3 for 6 h, before infecting with HSV-1-eGFP C12. Replication was monitored and slopes calculated and normalized to unstimulated, mock-transfected cells. (c) Overexpression of Med23 preferentially induces type III interferons. pCR3 or Med23 were overexpressed in A549 cells and induction of type I (IFN-β) and type III (IFN-λ1, IFN-λ2/3) was measured by qRT-PCR. mRNA levels were normalized to HPRT and calibrated to mock transfected cells (control). Error bars represent the mean of technical replicates and is representative of multiple experiments. * = p-value 0.003; ** = p-value 0.002 (unpaired t-tests for unequal variances). (d) Overexpression of Med23 induces IFN-λ secretion. A range of cell types were transfected with pCR3 or Med23, supernatant harvested 120 h post-transfection and IFN-λ3 levels measured by ELISA. Chart shows the mean and standard deviation of duplicates over two experiments. (e) siRNA depletion of Med23 inhibits the induction of IFN-λ2/3 following HSV-1 infection. A549 cells were transfected with control (RSCF) or Med23-specific siRNA (Med23 KD) before infecting with HSV-1-eGFP C12 (MOI 0.5). RNA was harvested 0 or 8 h post-infection and IFN-λ2/3 mRNA levels measured by qRT-PCR. Expression was normalized as above, and calibrated to RSCF-transfected cells at 0 h post-infection. Error bars represent the mean of technical replicates and is representative of multiple experiments. To determine which interferon may be responsible for the anti-viral effects of Med23, A549 cells were depleted for Med23 and infected with HSV-1 following pre-stimulation with Type I (IFN-α or IFN-β), Type II (IFN-γ) or Type III (the distinct IFN-λ1 or the almost identical IFN-λ2 and -λ3, termed IFN-λ2/3) interferons. Whilst treatment with IFN-α, -β and -γ significantly decreased HSV-1 replication levels, the observed ∼2-fold enhancement of HSV-1 replication following Med23 depletion was still seen. However, pre-treatment with the both IFN-λ1 and IFN-λ2/3 blocked the enhancing effect of Med23 depletion (Figure 4b). Investigation into the effect of Med23 on interferon induction by qRT-PCR found that whilst Med23 over-expression induced IFN-β (∼3-fold increase), induction of IFN-λ1 and λ2/3 was considerably and statistically significantly higher (∼26-fold induction; p = 0.003 and 0.002, respectively) (Figure 4c). This induction was specific, as levels of other cytokines and interferon-regulatory factors (IRFs) were unaffected by Med23 overexpression (Figure S7a). Secretion of IFN-λ2/3 protein was also increased in all cell lines tested, but most significantly to ∼11-fold in A549 cells (Figure 4d), which is consistent with a recent report showing that type III interferons are the dominant type of IFNs expressed by primary airway epithelial cells [44]. Furthermore, qPCR analysis found depletion of Med23 inhibited the induction of IFN-λ expression following HSV-1 infection of A549 cells in comparison to cells transfected with the RSCF siRNA control (Figure 4e). Together, these data suggest that IFN-λ is responsible for the observed inhibitory effect of Med23 on HSV-1 replication. IFN-λ is synergistically induced following a direct interaction between Med23 and IRF7
As IFN-λ expression is induced following activation of pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) by virus infection [45], [46], [47], [48], we tested whether Med23 induced IFN-λ by directly interacting with an interferon-responsive transcription factor (IRF). Y2H and confirmatory co-immunoprecipitation experiments in mammalian cells with a panel of IRFs found that Med23 interacted with IRF4 and IRF7 (Figure 5a; Figure S7b). We also observed a weak interaction with IRF9, which may explain the previously observed effect of Med23 on Jak/Stat signalling [42]. To determine if this interaction had a functional effect, we looked at whether Med23 influenced IRF-mediated induction of IFN-λ. In a luciferase reporter assay, neither IRF4 nor IRF9 led to a significant induction of the IFN-λ1 promoter, either alone or in conjunction with Med23 (data not shown). IRF7 induced expression from the IFN-β and IFN-λ1 promoters to similar levels (∼7-fold and 9-fold higher than background, respectively), whilst the ISRE, induced by IRF7 and also present in the IRF7 promoter, was induced ∼15-fold (Figure 5b). Whilst co-expression of Med23 with IRF7 had no further effect on IFN-β expression, a synergistic induction of the IFN-λ1 promoter and, to a lesser extent, the ISRE, was observed (IFN-λ1 doubled to ∼18-fold, p = 0.02) (Figure 5b). Interestingly, a Med23 mutant unable to induce immediate early gene expression via jun/fos (R617Q, or R611Q in Med23 transcript variant 1 used here) synergistically induced ISRE expression with IRF7, yet was unable to further enhance IRF7-mediated induction of IFN-λ1 (data not shown). A similar synergistic effect of Med23 and IRF7 was seen at the protein level, where co-expression increased supernatant levels of IFN-λ3 more than 2-fold those seen with Med23 or IRF7 alone (Figure S7c, d).

Med23 induces IFN-λ by interacting with the transcription factor IRF7.
(a) Med23 directly interacts with IRFs. Med23 was overexpressed in HEK cells as a myc-tagged fusion protein individually with a range of HA-tagged IRFs. Protein amounts were quantified and equal amounts (325 µg) were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-HA or anti-myc antibody before western blot analysis and staining with anti-HA (WB) to confirm protein expression (IP; anti-HA IP) and identify interaction partners (Co-IP; anti-myc IP) (b) Med23 synergistically induces IRF7-responsive promoters. A549 cells were transfected with IFN-λ1-, IFN-β- or ISRE-responsive luciferase reporter constructs with IRF7 alone or in addition to Med23. Promoter activity was determined by measurement of Firefly luciferase activity 33 hr post-transfection, and normalized to Renilla luciferase and pCR3-transfected cells. Error bars represent the mean of at least three independent experiments. Statistical significance of the synergistic increase in IFN-λ induction by Med23 with IRF7 over IFN-β induction was determined by unpaired t-tests for unequal variances. * = p-value 0.02. IFN-λ gene expression is associated with the recurrence and severity of recurrent HSV-1 disease
Successful disease and treatment outcome in Hepatitis C virus infection (demonstration of a sustained virologic response) is strongly associated with a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the IFN-λ3 promoter (rs12979860; CC genotype over CT or TT) and higher plasma levels of IFN-λ3 [49],[50]. Furthermore, IFN-λ expression is impaired in a cohort of ethnically Italian individuals suffering recurrent HSV-1-related herpes labialis reactivation [51]. To determine if the clinical severity of HSV-1 disease is due to the observed deficiency in IFN-λ expression, we screened a subset of the recurrent herpes labialis (HL) cohort and additional subjects for the IFN-λ3 promoter polymorphism. Genotypic analysis found the presence of a T (CT or TT genotype) had a dose-dependent association with clinical severity, with the homozygous TT genotype being more prevalent as disease severity increases (Figure 6). In spite of the relatively small sample numbers in some clinical categories (Table 1), the association of a CT or TT genotype with the most severe recurrence of herpes labialis (H+) was statistically significant (p = 0.014; Fishers's exact t-test). As the CC genotype is directly associated with increased IFN-λ3 levels [51], these data highlight a previously unknown association between the frequency/severity of recurrence of herpes labialis, the CT/TT genotype and subsequent reduction in secretion of IFN-λ3. It is of importance to investigate this genotype association with a larger cohort of HL patients, as well as those suffering with other HSV-1-related disease, in order to determine the role of IFN-λ in the full spectrum of HSV-1 pathogenesis.

Taken together, these data identify Med23 as a novel anti-viral factor which acts as a key regulator of IFN-λ expression by interacting with and enhancing the activity of IRF7, a major transcription factor involved in innate immunity. Our observation of a link between the clinical severity of HSV-1 disease and, a CT/TT genotype at a SNP known to regulate IFN-λ3 secretion demonstrates the significance of IFN-λ in the control of HSV-1 replication in vivo. Whilst this study provides no direct link between the IFN-λ3 promoter polymorphism and Med23, these associations of IFN-λ with HSV-1 disease, combined with our observations that Med23 is required for the induction of IFN-λ following HSV-1 infection, identifies for the first time a link between Med23 and IFN-λ, provides a clinical context for Med23 regulation of IFN-λ expression and underscores the potential biological significance of these data.
The use of HSV-1 in a combined genome-scale screening approach has led to the identification of a regulatory axis in anti-viral innate immunity, and this important finding not only highlights the power of such combined genome-scale screening approaches to identify novel host candidates for anti-herpesvirus drug discovery, but provides an invaluable dataset to the herpesvirus and scientific community at large.
By nature of their scale, high-throughput screening technologies have limitations. RNAi technology is limited by technical issues such as off-target effects, where an alternative gene to the intended target is degraded, and insufficient gene knockdown. Similarly, Y2H protein interaction screens can generate both false-positive interactions, due to ‘sticky’ proteins and auto-activation of the reporter gene used, and false-negative interactions. Whereas the number of false positives can be considerably reduced by stringent screening and selection criteria, the low sensitivity of the Y2H assay, which detects 20–30% of known interactions, is inherent to the system and can only be marginally improved. This poor sensitivity is caused by factors such as structural restraints of the Y2H bait and prey fusion proteins, a lack of or existence of distinct protein modification in yeast cells, and cellular localization signals in bait and prey proteins preventing nuclear import [52]. However, as all other high-throughput methods for measuring binary protein interactions possess a similarly low sensitivity, but are considerably more laborious and expensive, the Y2H system is still the most commonly used technology [53].In this study we have exploited a combined genome-wide screening approach to investigate HSV-1 replication and interaction with its host. This identified 358 functional HFs modulating HSV-1 replication, and 63 cellular interaction partners. In validation experiments, 57.8% of the interactions were confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation assays in mammalian cells, and of the 358 functional HFs identified in the siRNA screen, the phenotype of 83.3% was confirmed in deconvoluted siRNA experiments. This, combined with qPCR data demonstrating a minimum gene depletion of 69%, suggests that the functional phenotypes on virus replication are genuine, and not due to ‘off-target’ effects. The confirmation of such a high proportion of selected validation candidates, in spite of the potential technical drawbacks, highlights the reliability of our primary screen datasets, and thus provides an invaluable resource for the herpesvirology research community.One interesting outcome of this study was the surprisingly low overlap between hits identified using these different technologies. Of the 215 genes in common between the siRNA and cDNA libraries, only 10 (4.7%) were classified as a hit by both methods. This, however, is not unexpected, as even the overlap between studies using the same technology has been reported to be low. For example, the overlap between the three previously published HIV screens was only 7% [19]. Furthermore, the degree of functional redundancy within the siRNA library, and cellular pathways in general, the potential situation-specificity of virus-host interactions, and the possibility of indirect interactions between viral and host proteins, suggest that these methodologies detecting functional outcomes or physical interactions are linked, but complementary rather than confirmatory.The identified HFs were enriched for a range of cellular processes, such as transcription, gene expression, protein transport and cell cycle (Figure S2 and S3), and involved at different stages of viral infection. We investigated HFs involved in capsid transport and ubiquitination of antiviral intrinsic host defence factors in more detail. Incoming HSV-1 capsids are transported to nuclear pores via the microtubule-organizing centre (MTOC), mediated by capsid proteins VP26 (UL35) and UL46 binding to the dynein light chains DYNLT1 (Tctex1) and DYNLT3 (rp3) [54], [55]. Our Y2H screen confirmed the known interaction between the capsid protein VP26 and the dynein light chain DYNLT3 (Text S1 and Figure S4). Combined with the siRNA screen data, which found depletion of multiple light chain subunits had moderate anti-viral effects on HSV-1, these data confirm propositions of redundancy in the capsid transport process which ensures successful infection in the event of viral mutations [38], [39], and provide further evidence that HSV-1 has evolved to be highly promiscuous in its exploitation of cellular pathways to its advantage.To overcome the intrinsic host defence, HSV-1 induces a proteasome-dependent degradation of anti-viral promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies (ND10 domains) by the RING-finger ubiquitin ligase ICP0 expressed during early infection [56]. In vitro, ICP0 is a biochemically active E3 ubiquitin ligase in the presence of E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzymes (E2s) [UBE2D1 (UbcH5a) and UBE2E1 (UbcH6)] [57], but which E2s are used during infection has remained unclear. We identified 20 cellular E2s that are able to influence HSV-1 replication (Text S1 and Figure S5). Depletion of UBE2D1-4, UBE2E1-3 and UBE2N significantly increased the number of PML-positive cells post-infection, in an ICP0-dependent manner, indicating that ICP0 can use multiple E2s to degrade PML [57], [58].One of the multi-protein complexes affecting HSV-1 replication was the Mediator complex, a large (>30 subunits) complex which links specific transcription factors to the RNA polymerase II transcription machinery [40]. As the requirement of Mediator subunits in the replication of herpes and other viruses is already well-known [7], [9], [11], [41], it was striking that depletion of the Med23 subunit exerted the opposite phenotype and led to a strong increase in virus growth. The Mediator is composed of four distinct modules termed the head, middle, tail and kinase domains, which provide the Mediator with some degree of active control over transcription [59]. As individual subunits of this large complex interact with and exert functional effects via specific transcription factors, it is not unexpected that the observed anti-viral effects were specific to Med23 [60]. Within the Mediator, Med23 forms a tight sub-complex with Med24 and Med16 [60], [61]. The increase in virus replication observed upon depletion of Med24 may be caused by the destabilisation of the structure of this sub-complex (Figure S6b).Investigations into the mechanism of action revealed Med23 inhibits HSV-1 replication by preferentially inducing a type III interferon response (IFN-λ) at the mRNA and protein level. This induction was mediated via a direct interaction with the transcription factor IRF7, which resulted in a synergistic increase in IFN-λ expression. Med23 was unable, however, to further enhance IRF7-induced levels of IFN-β, suggesting an additional level of complexity to the regulation of interferon signalling. Interestingly, the inhibitory effect of Med23 was specific to HSV-1, with replication of a range of other viruses including Vaccinia virus and Semliki Forest Virus being unaffected by Med23 depletion. As Vaccinia virus is resistant to IFN-λ anti-viral activity [62], this observation further highlights the importance of IFN-λ, as opposed to IFN-β, in the anti-viral effect of Med23. The R617Q mutation in Med23 (R611Q in Med23 transcript variant 1, used here) was unable to enhance IRF7-induced IFN-λ expression. This mutation causes hereditary dementia [63], and the failure to induce IFN-λ and thereby control HSV-1 in the brain may be a potential cofactor for the development of dementia, similar to Alzheimer's disease [64].There is mounting evidence for a role of the IFN-λ family in the regulation of virus pathogenesis [45], particularly in the case of Hepatitis C infection where a polymorphism in the promoter region of IFN-λ3 (IL-28B; polymorphism rs12979860), which correlates with plasma levels of IFN-λ3 [50], is associated with disease and treatment outcome [49]. Individuals with recurrent HSV-1 reactivation have been shown to be deficient in IFN-λ expression [51], and here we found the similar association between the IFN-λ3 promoter polymorphism and ethnically Italian patients suffering recurrent and severe reactivations of HSV-1-related oral herpes outbreaks, albeit with a small sample group (n = 58). Furthermore, sporadic mutations and genetic polymorphisms in innate immune receptor and signalling molecules that lead to the induction of type I and III IFNs have also been shown to be associated with Herpes Encephalitis [65], as well as oral and genital Herpes [66], [67].HSV infection controlled by a complex, interconnected and highly regulated network of cytokines expressed by innate immune cells. Type I IFNs mainly produced by HSV-infected keratinocytes [68] and pDCs [69] inhibit the spread from neurons to epithelial cells and between epithelial cells [70], similar to IFN-γ. Type III IFNs are also able to directly inhibit HSV-1 infection in primary neurons, astrocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells [71], [72]. IFN-γ levels produced by peripheral blood CD4+ T-cells correlate with the frequency of HSV-1 reactivation [73]. IFN-λ is able to induce expression of both itself and the type I IFNs, and a similar effect has also been observed for type I IFNs which induce both type I and III IFNs [71], [72]. Type III IFNs are mainly expressed by myeloid dendritic cells (mDC) and monocyte-derived macrophages [74], and signal through the heterodimeric IL10RB/IL28RA receptor complex whose expression is largely restricted to cells of epithelial origin and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC), in contrast to the broadly expressed type I IFN receptor (IFN-αR1/2) [75], [76]. Since primary HSV-1 infection and reactivation affects skin and mucosa in the majority of cases, IFN-λ may play a much greater role in the control of HSV-1 pathogenesis, likely in a complex network of coregulated type I and II IFNS, than previously thought. We hypothesize that HSV-infected DCs at the site of the lesion (such as skin Langerhans DCs whose role in IFN-λ production is currently unknown, or intruding myeloid DCs) in individuals with the rs12979860 T/T or C/T haplotype express reduced levels of type III IFNs, and, in consequence, of type I IFNs, which leads to a reduced inhibition of local HSV-1 replication and the occurrence of fresh skin lesions. However, the relative contribution of IFN-λ1 and λ2/3 to the interferon-mediated control of HSV-1 replication in vivo, and indeed the role of Med23 in this, remains to be seen.In summary, this study provides a comprehensive and robust analysis of HFs that influence HSV-1 replication in vitro, which will benefit many future studies on HSV-1. The identification of Med23 as a crucial cellular component for IFN-λ expression, and evidence for the significant role of type III IFN in the innate immune control of HSV-1 in vitro and in vivo, demonstrates the power of combined, genome-scale studies to identify physiologically important HFs for virus pathogenesis. Future studies will clarify the role of genetic variations in both Med23 and IFN-λ in HSV-1-related diseases, such as meningitis, keratitis and orolabial/genital reactivations."
