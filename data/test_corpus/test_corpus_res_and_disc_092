Twenty-four (40%) patients had KIR3DS1, and 36 (60%) did not. Among patients with KIR3DS1, 9 (37.5%) had Bw4/Bw4, 4 (16.6%) Bw4/Bw6 and 11 (45.9%) Bw6/Bw6. The distribution of KIR3DS1 and HLA-B by IL28B genotype is shown in Table 2. In our study, 38.6% of patients carrying the IL28B-CC genotype had KIR3DS1/Bw4, whereas only 17.9% of non-CC patients had KIR3DS1/Bw4 (p = 0.016).

Influence of KIR3DS1 and IL28B on HCV viral decline
As shown in Figure 1, patients with KIR3DS1/Bw4 showed greater HCV viral decline than those who did not carry KIR3DS1 or who had KIR3DS/Bw6, at week 1 (KIR3DS1/Bw4: 1.47±0.49; KIR3DS1/Bw6: 0.508±0.41; No KIR3DS1: 0.48±0.37 UI log10/mL, p = 0.01), week 2 (KIR3DS1/Bw4: 1.82±0.47; KIR3DS1/Bw6: 1.29±0.61; No KIR3DS1: 0.77±0.49 UI log10/mL, p = 0.038) and week 4 (KIR3DS1/Bw4: 2.53±0.56; KIR3DS1/Bw6: 1.71±0.74; No KIR3DS1: 1.47±0.81 UI log10/mL, p = 0.03). A key point of our results is that there were no differences, at any time point analyzed, between patients who carried KIR3DS1/Bw6 and those who did not have KIR3DS1 (week1: p = 0.527; week2: p = 0.173; week 4: p = 0.358) (Figure 1).

Carriers of the IL28-CC genotype showed greater reductions in plasma HCV RNA levels than non-CC genotype carriers at every time point analyzed (week 1: 0.98±0.72 versus 0.39±0.51 UI log10/mL, p = 0.017; week 2: 1.67±0.81 versus 0.83±0.77 UI log10/mL, p = 0.028; week 4: 2.28±0.62 versus 1.47±1.06 UI log10/mL, p = 0.037). Influence of both IL28B genotype and KIR3DS1/Bw4 on HCV viral clearance
Among carriers of the IL28B-CC genotype, those with KIR3DS1/Bw4 had higher rates of HCV viral clearance than those who were not KIR3DS1/Bw4 carriers (week 1: 2.51±0.67 versus 0.501±0.41 UI log10/mL, p<0.001; week 2: 2.82±0.73 versus 1.39±0.72 UI log10/mL, p = 0.01; week 4: 3.62±0.78 versus 1.98±0.98 UI log10/mL, p = 0.02) (Figure 2A). However, among IL28B non-CC genotype patients, no differences of HCV viral clearance were found irrespective of whether they carried KIR3DS1/Bw4 or not (week 1: 0.78±0.57 versus 0.41±0.39 UI log10/mL, p = 0.476; week 2: 1.01±0.67 versus 1.03±0.82 UI log10/mL, p = 0.699; week 4: 1.97±0.86 versus 1.51±0.84 UI log10/mL, p = 0.755) (Figure 2B).

HCV viral decline for KIR3DS1 and its ligands in patients carrying the IL28B-CC (2A) or IL28B non-CC genotypes (2B). When HCV viral clearance of patients carrying KIR3DS1/Bw4 was compared, those with the IL28B-CC genotype had higher rates of viral decline than those with the non-CC genotype (week 1: p<0.001; week 2: p = 0.03; week 4: p = 0.037). On the other hand, when we compared patients who did not carry KIR3DS1/Bw4, we did not find any differences of HCV viral clearance in the first weeks of treatment on the basis of IL28B genotype (week 1: p = 0.827; week 2: p = 0.725; week 4: p = 0.429).
The linear regression models showed that having KIR3DS1/Bw4, the IL28B-CC genotype and a low baseline HCV viral load were independent predictors of HCV viral decline between baseline and weeks 1, 2 and 4 (Table 3).

Treatment response rate
Eleven (18.3%) patients discontinued treatment due to abandoning therapy or adverse events. Of these patients, 8 carried IL28B non-CC (5 did not carry KIR3DS1, 2 had KIR3DS1/Bw6 and 1 had KIR3DS1/Bw4) and 3 carried IL28B-CC (2 did not carry KIR3DS1 and 1 had KIR3DS1/Bw4). Patients carrying KIR3DS/Bw4 achieved higher RVR and SVR rates than those who did not carry KIR3DS1/Bw4 (RVR: 6 [46.15%] versus 8 [17.02%], p = 0.012; SVR: 7 [63.6%] versus 13 [26.5%], p = 0.031). Patients with the IL28B-CC genotype had higher rates of RVR and SVR than those with the non-CC genotype (RVR: 8 [38.01%] versus 5 [12.8%], p = 0.03; SVR: 10 [55.5%] versus 10 [32.2%], p = 0.027). Patients carrying both the IL28B-CC genotype and KIR3DS1/Bw4 alleles had higher RVR and SVR rates than patients carrying only one or neither of these (Table 4).

Our results also suggest that the beneficial impact of IL28B-CC on HCV treatment response may be enhanced by the presence of KIR3DS1.NK cells play an important role in the outcome of several inflammatory diseases and contribute to the spontaneous resolution of infection [10]. The mechanism involves the activation of NK cells via endogenous IFN-γ production. Since HCV viral treatment is based on administering IFN-α, a dose of IFN-α activates NK cell cytotoxicity and improves HCV clearance [12], [13]. The presence of a specific KIR on the surface of the NK cell or its specific ligand on the hepatocyte surface could therefore increase or reduce the elimination of infected HCV cells and, in consequence, modify HCV viral decline. In this respect, the presence of some inhibitor KIRs (2DL1, 2DL3 and 3DL1) on the NK cell surface has been associated with weak HCV viral decline [16], [17], [23]–[25]. The ligand for KIR3DS1 has not been clearly identified, since no experimental evidence has been reported [19], [22]; even though Martin et al found an association between HLA-Bw4 and KIR3DS1 [26], there is still no consensus about the matter. Nonetheless, since KIR3DS1 and KIR3DL1 share a high degree of amino acid similarity in their extracellular domains, they might be expected to share a similar set of ligands [27]. In our study, we tested KIR3DS1, which participates in activating NK cells, and found that those patients who carried it showed greater HCV viral decline, leading to higher viral response rates, than those who did not.In our study, the positive effect of the IL28B-CC genotype on HCV viral clearance during the first weeks of treatment was closely associated with KIR3DS1/Bw4. In this respect, patients carrying the IL28B-CC genotype had high HCV viral clearances only in the presence of KIR3DS1. In contrast, we found that, among those carrying the IL28B non-CC genotype, it made no difference whether they carried KIR3DS1 or not, in terms of influence on viral clearance. This is an important point because it tends to suggest that the positive effect of the IL28B-CC genotype on HCV treatment response could be conditioned by innate immunological status. This finding coincides with a recent report by Naggie et al, who reported that patients carrying the IL28B-CC genotype have a superior innate immune response to IFN-therapy than IL28B non-CC genotype patients [6]. These findings would be consistent with the accepted IL28B mechanism (endogenous-IFN activity), in the sense that, in chronic HCV infection, NK cells exhibit a polarized NK cell phenotype with decreased IFN-γ production [12]. This also supports the finding that patients carrying the IL28B-CC genotype have lower endogenous IFN activity than those with the non-CC genotype. Thus, a higher, but inadequate, endogenous IFN activity would lead to suboptimal stimulation of NK cells and a refractory effect when exogenous IFN was added [12]. This activity might condition the response to IFN-based therapy, depending on the host's baseline characteristics. So, determining the IL28B genotype alone would have limited power, since it could be conditioned by NK activation, regulated, at least in part, by KIR3DS1.KIR3DS1, on the other hand, has been associated with slowing disease progression in HIV infection [28]–[31]. For this reason, we cannot rule out the possibility that patients with KIR3DS1 may have both an innate and adaptive immune system that is less negatively impacted by HIV infection, and so have a stronger immune response to HCV treatment than patients who are not carriers of KIR3DS1. However, the observed effect of KIR3DS1 on HCV treatment response could be due to the relative absence of KIR3DL1, rather than the presence of KIR3DS1. KIR3DL1 play an inhibitory role on NK cell activity. The functional union of KIR3DL1 with HLA-Bw4 triggers a “do not eat” reaction in NK cells with respect to the target cell [32]. One study showed that highly expressed KIR3DL1 alleles were beneficial in HIV disease and suggested that indirect effects on HIV could be the cause [33]. Consequently, if this effect is independent of HIV co-infection, the absence of KIR3DL1 alleles may release inhibition, resulting in more efficient lysis of infected hepatocytes in a KIR3DS1-independent manner.The standard of care HCV treatment is due to change for HIV/HCV genotype 1 patients in the coming years [34]. The incorporation of the new protease inhibitors (PIs) to Peg-IFN/RBV will improve the rate of treatment response in this group of patients, as they did with HCV monoinfected patients [35], [36]. However, in the particular case of HIV protease inhibitors, interactions with antiretroviral treatment will have to be added to the drawbacks of the new PIs, along with a higher rate of adverse events and the cost of HIV/HCV co-infected patients [37]. This will be a key aspect of HCV treatment for HIV co-infected patients, since some will need to switch antiretroviral treatment, which has various clinical limitations. This is why identifying HIV/HCV co-infected patients who will respond to Peg-IFN/RBV therapy is a key feature of HIV clinical practice. Our results show that the major impact of NK cells, principally KIR3DS1, is on HCV viral decline during the first week of treatment. These findings could be used to optimize the choice of the most appropriate therapy for HIV/HCV co-infected patients bearing genotype 1 and to enhance the value of IL28B determination. Our findings could enable clinicians to detect patients with higher or lower probabilities of responding to Peg-IFN/RBV therapy.However, our study has several limitations. Firstly, this study is a preliminary investigation since it included a small number of patients and did not have the statistical power to detect differences of KIR3DS1 among patients carrying the IL28B non-CC genotype. A larger cohort of HIV/HCV genotype 1 co-infected patients is required to analyze this. Secondly, our study determined only KIR3DS1 and rs12979860 when considering the respective impacts of NK cell KIR and IL28B. Studies analyzing the synergistic effect of other known KIRs (3DL3, 2DS2, 2DL2, 2DL3, 2DL5, 2DS3, 2DS1, 3DL2, 2DP1, 2DL1, 3DP1, 2DL4, 3DL1, 2DS5 and 2DS4) and IL28B (rs8099917) are needed. Thirdly, Bw4 alleles (Bw4*80I and *80T) were not considered in our study, which may be a limitation since these variations could play a role in conditioning the affinity of KIR3DS1 for Bw4. A fourth limitation is that this study included only HIV/HCV co-infected patients, which represents a unique population. In fact, HIV/HCV co-infected subjects attain SVR less frequently than HCV monoinfected individuals and their HCV viral decline is slower [38]. Hence, further studies of the predictive yield of KIR3DS1 variants are needed, which include HCV monoinfected patients. Finally, in our study, every patient carrying the IL28B-CC genotype with KIR3DS1 had HLA-Bw4, whereas no patient carrying the IL28B-CC genotype with KIR3DS1 had HLA-Bw6. It is not known whether there is a possible association between these factors. It is likely, however, that our observation was due to the small number of patients. A larger cohort would clarify these findings.In conclusion, our study shows that KIR3DS1 has a positive impact on HCV viral clearance in Peg-IFN/RBV treatment in HIV/HCV co-infected patients bearing genotype 1, and this may be associated with the IL28B mechanism of action in HCV treatment response."
