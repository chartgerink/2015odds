"Distribution of IL28B and IFNL4 polymorphisms
The distribution of the IL28B rs12979860/rs8099917 and IFNL4 rs368234815 polymorphisms is shown in Table 1. All populations was in HWE (p>0.05) for the three polymorphisms. The Huicholes and Nahuas had lower allelic frequencies for the protective alleles associated with SC than the Mestizos (p<0.05). Conversely, both Amerindian groups had the highest frequency of the respective T, G, ΔG risk alleles for CHC infection. In the Mestizos, the overall frequency of protective alleles for SC was above 58%. 10.1371/journal.pone.0146258.t001

* The pooled prevalence of Amerindians alleles vs. pooled prevalence of Mestizos alleles was significant (p<0.05). Villa Pur, Villa Purificación; WM, West Mexico Distribution of IL28B and IFNL4 haplotypes and genetic relationship among populations
The degree of LD of the IL28B and IFNL4 polymorphisms varied among the studied populations (S1 Table). IL28B rs12979860 polymorphism was in high LD (r2 = 0.72–1) with IFNL4 rs368234815 in all populations, while the IL28B rs8099917 polymorphism was in moderate LD with the rs368234815 (IFNL4) variant, except in the Nahuas population (r2 = 0.92).
The distribution of five haplotypes found in this study is shown in Table 2. The most frequent combination among the Mestizos was the C/T/TT haplotype (IL28B rs12979860/IL28B rs8099917/IFNL4 rs368234815) containing the protective alleles associated with SC. Notably, the population of Villa Purificación had the highest frequency of this haplotype (73.5%). Conversely, the T/G/∆G haplotype containing the risk alleles associated with CHC infection was the most frequent (>55%) among Huicholes and Nahuas and was the second most prevalent in the Mestizo populations (19–30%). The remaining three haplotypes had frequencies of <16%. 10.1371/journal.pone.0146258.t002

For comparative purposes, the frequencies of African, Caucasian and Japanese populations reported in the HapMap Project were included as references [26]. Three clusters were generated from the studied populations (p>0.05) (Fig 1). The individuals from Villa Purificación, Jalisco formed a cluster on the lower right side of the plot together with the Caucasian reference subjects, whereas the Amerindians, Huicholes and Nahuas grouped in the lower left corner. As expected, the Mestizos from Guadalajara and the total West Mexico data formed an intermediate cluster. 10.1371/journal.pone.0146258.g001

aHCV genotype was available for 113 individuals in the chronic infection group. BMI, body mass index; AST, aspartate aminotransferase; ALT, alanine aminotransferase; NA, not applicable; NS, not significant. The mean age was 49.4 ± 12.5 years for the CHC patients and 46.8 ± 13.9 in the SC group. No differences in age, gender and body mass index were found between groups. Higher levels of AST and ALT enzymes were found in the patients with CHC infection than in those with SC (p<0.05). The CHC patients were mainly carriers of HCV genotype 1a (47.8%) and 1b (15%) followed by genotypes 2 and 3. The duration of infection among HCV-patients was estimated by the self-reported date of exposure to known risk factors for HCV infection, which were mainly blood transfusion, surgery, tattoos and injecting drug use [16]. When the HCV-patients were compared by ancestry contribution, according to IL28B and IFNL4 genotypes, the Structure software analysis identified three well-differentiated populations (κ = 3). The European, African and Amerindian ancestry was similar in both the SC and CHC patients (p<0.05). Also, the frequency of two AIMs (rs4988235 and rs7412) was not significantly different between the SC and HCV patients (S3 Table).
Moreover, the CHC patients were stratified by stage of liver damage (Table 4). Significant differences in the indicators of liver damage were observed between stages F1 and F4. However, there were no differences in the duration of infection between CHC patients with mild and severe fibrosis (F1-F2, 26.7 ± 13.7 vs. F3-F4, 27.6 ± 14.0 years, p = 0.7). 10.1371/journal.pone.0146258.t004

* Due to lack of sample availability, only 172 and 181 patients were tested for rs8099917 and rs368234815, respectively. A dominant genetic model was used to assess the association of the IL28B/IFNL4 haplotypes with SC and liver damage. The C/T/TT haplotype was associated with SC (C/T/TT vs. T/G-T/∆G; OR = 0.46, 95% IC 0.22–0.95 p = 0.03) (Table 6). Additionally, the association between the haplotype frequency among the CHC patients with liver damage (F1 vs. F4) showed that the C/T/TT haplotype carriers had less liver damage compared to the T/G/∆G haplotype carriers (OR = 0.32, 95% IC 0.10–0.97, p = 0.04) (Table 7). 10.1371/journal.pone.0146258.t006

In this study, the IL28B rs12979860/rs8099917 and IFNL4 rs368234815 alleles, genotypes, and their respective haplotypes showed different frequency distributions between Amerindian and Mestizo populations. The lowest frequency of the individual C, T, TT alleles was found in the Amerindians and the highest in Mestizos (p<0.05). This data is in agreement with the historical, genetic and cultural backgrounds of each study group [29, 30]. To our knowledge, this is the first study regarding the genetic features of the rs8099917 and rs368234815 polymorphisms in Amerindian populations from Mexico. In this study, the Huicholes and Nahuas exhibited a greater frequency of the ancestral rs368234815 ∆G allele. Conversely, the Mestizos populations showed the highest prevalence of the respective C, G and TT alleles known to be associated with SC. These frequencies are consistent with those reported by others in Central Mexico, which are similar to Mexican-Americans and Caucasians [31–33]. Thus, given this pattern of genetic structure, it is plausible that this may also occur in other native and admixed groups throughout Latin America [34], although further studies are needed to evaluate this assumption.Given the close location of the IL28B (rs12979860, rs8099917) and IFNL4 (rs368234815) polymorphisms, several studies have been performed to calculate the levels of LD between the two genes [9,35, 36]. In this study, a high LD (r2 = 0.72–1) between rs12979860 and rs368234815 was found in all studied populations. However, lower LD values were found among the Mestizos for rs8099917 and rs368234815 compared to the Nahuas. Thus, when inferring the haplotypes, we found an overall heterogenic distribution. The T/G/∆G haplotype (rs12979860 /rs8099917/rs368234815) was the most frequent among the Amerindians, whereas the C/T/TT haplotype was higher in the Mestizos. Among these, the population from Villa Purificación showed the highest frequency of this haplotype, which is consistent with data previously reported in regards to their strong European ancestry [20]. Furthermore, the frequencies of the protective haplotype C/T/TT observed in the Mestizos and HCV-infected patients from Guadalajara were both similar to those reported in Caucasians [9]. Thus, it is plausible that the European genetic component that exists in the Mestizos populations from West Mexico favors the predominance of C/T/TT haplotype [15]. On the other hand, the high frequency of the T/G/∆G haplotype in the Amerindians was consistent with the allelic and genotypic frequencies found in this study. These findings may also explain why it is the second most frequent in the Mestizos populations, due to the admixture of European and Amerindian ancestry [15].Moreover, it has been reported that SC is influenced by host factors [37]. Among these, the immune response plays a critical role in SC and the development of liver damage in HCV patients [38]. In this study, the rs12979860CC and rs368234815TT/TT genotype were associated with SC in Mestizos patients of West Mexico, which is in agreement with previous research [9, 39–41]. However, to the best of our knowledge, the association of rs368234815TT/TT genotype with SC has not been previously reported among HCV patients in Mexico and Latin America. Furthermore, the association of this polymorphism with SC is maintained among the admixed population with Caucasian ancestry and in less proportion in the Amerindians. Also, the genetic ancestry was equally distributed among the SC and CHC patients. Thus, the association with SC was independent of the admixture among the study groups. In regards to the socio-economic factors that may influence the clinical outcome, the CHC patients attending the hospital have an urban residence, belong to a middle-income status and are exposed to the same environmental factors. On the other hand, no association was found with the rs8099917TT genotype and SC. This result is consistent with a report in Chinese patients [35] and with one previous study in Central Mexico that found no association with the response to pegIFN-α/RBV therapy [32]. In concordance with these observations, in this study the C/T/TT haplotype was associated with SC and less liver damage than those with the risk haplotype.The mechanism by which these alleles are associated with SC or chronic infection remains unclear. For example, micro RNA-122 expression in rs12979860 CT/TT carriers had been related to liver fibrosis [42]. However, it is plausible that it may be linked to different immune response profiles. Studies in vitro have shown that IFNL4 induces expression of CCL5 (RANTES), a molecule considered a biomarker of early-stage liver damage [9, 10, 43, 44]. This could be the reason patients carrying the ∆G allele present greater liver damage. Furthermore, this hypothesis is consistent with recent findings that demonstrated that chronic HCV-infected patients express higher levels of interleukin-8 and RANTES in comparison with those who had SC [45]. Nonetheless, the impact of IL28B and IFNL4 polymorphisms on HCV-related disease progression is controversial [46–49]. The discrepancy in disease outcome reported worldwide may be due to differential immunogenetic responses based on ethnic and environmental factors, such as diet, physical activity, obesity and other associated co-morbidities [37, 50].Among the Old World human populations, positive selection may be responsible for the increased frequency of the protective rs368234815TT allele [51]. However, the presence of the TT allele among the Mestizo group may be due to the recent introduction of the European component into the New World Amerindian population (some 500 years ago) [50] combined with the exposure to diverse viral agents. In contrast, the high frequency of the ancestral ∆G allele and haplotypes in Amerindians mirrors that of non-admixed human populations. Therefore, in regards to the Mexican population, it is plausible that carriers of the ∆G allele regardless of the Mestizo or Amerindian ancestry could have a more complicated clinical outcome if they were infected with HCV. Furthermore, HCV genotypes 1a and 1b are the most predominant in the country and pegIFN-α/RBV is the conventional antiviral treatment [52, 53]. Thus the likelihood of SVR decreases and significant adverse effects may occur [54]. However, further studies are needed to test these hypotheses.Interestingly, the Amerindian groups in Mexico appear to be protected against the progression of HBV infection [50, 55]. Nonetheless, distinct mechanisms may be involved in the progression of HBV and HCV in this population. Although IL28B polymorphism does not predict long-term response to interferon therapy in HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B patients [56], previous reports have shown that a cytokine expression profile evoked by HBV infection is different between Amerindians and Mestizos population [55]. Thus, it is liable to expect immune-based differences against HCV in these groups. On the other hand, it is of notice that the Amerindian populations throughout Latin America are endemic for HBV infection [57] and, it is accepted that HBV/HCV co-infections cause more severe liver damage [58]. Consequently, there is an urgent need for improving our understanding of the mechanisms involved in the progression of the infections associated with these etiological agents. Furthermore, the impact of the IL28B/IFNL4 haplotypes requires to be evaluated in the context of the current therapies available for handling CHC patients.On the other hand, it has been suggested that metabolic factors could be playing a role in the clinical outcome of HCV infection [37]. IL28B polymorphisms have been related to the content of serum lipids [59, 60]. In this context, the Mexican population is currently in a high state of metabolic disorders and obesity, which are accompanied by insulin resistance a common characteristic of HCV infection [61, 62]. However, further studies are needed to evaluate the impact of this condition on the outcome of HCV infection among our population.Finally, our data creates the basis to develop strategies regarding personalized medicine for the Mexican population to minimize side effects and to maximize treatment success [63]. Moreover, they highlight the need to study these polymorphisms in other admixed populations in Latin America and abroad. The C/T/TT haplotype could be a powerful tool to predict SC and response to therapy and potentially to enable physicians to select better candidates for antiviral treatment.In conclusion, a heterogeneous genotypic distribution of the IL28B/IFNL4 polymorphisms among Mestizos and Amerindian populations from West Mexico was evident. The clinical outcome of CHC infection in Mexican Mestizos may be influenced by the C/T/TT and T/G/∆G haplotypes, whereas the potential T/G/∆G high-risk haplotype predominated in Amerindians."
