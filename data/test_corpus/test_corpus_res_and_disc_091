"Study cohort
The characteristics of the mothers included in this study are described in Table S1. There were no significant differences in median age, gestational age (period of time between conception and birth), type of birth, new-born weight, etc. However, of the 89 HCV-RNA+ve mothers, 21 (23%) had IL28B CC polymorphism whereas among the 33 HCV-RNA-ve women (control group), 20 (61%) had IL28B CC polymorphism (P>0.01). Accordingly, the mothers with non-CC IL28B polymorphism had a greater probability of being HCV-RNA+ve than did those with CC polymorphism (OR = 3.01; 95%CI: 1.3–5.7; P = 0.02). 74% of the HCV-RNA+ve mothers had been infected by parenteral route. The mean value of the viral load in the HCV-RNA+ve mothers was 2,709,588 IU/mL and 75% of these mothers had viral genotype 1. Moreover, 54% of the HCV-RNA+ve women had high viral load (>600,000 UI/mL) at delivery. ALT and cytokine evolution in HCV-RNA+ve vs. HCV-RNA-ve mothers
The evolution of ALT in the HCV-RNA+ve and in the HCV-RNA-ve women is shown in Figure 1A. Interestingly, non-significant differences in ALT values were observed between these groups during the third trimester of pregnancy (from week 28 of gestation to the end of the pregnancy), and at delivery. However, after delivery (3–6 months post-partum), the HCV-RNA+ve mothers showed higher ALT levels than did the HCV-RNA-ve mothers (98.32±9.34 U/L vs. 17.42±1.77 U/L; P<0.001). Moreover, the HCV-RNA+ve mothers presented a significant increase in Th1 cytokines at 3–6 months post-partum (ΔINFγ = INFγpost-partum–INFγpartum = 9.1±2.5ρg/mL, P = 0.03; ΔIL12 = IL12post-partum–IL12partum = 0.85±0.30ρg/mL, P = 0.01 and ΔIL2 = IL2post-partum–IL2partum = 5.4±2.89ρg/mL, P = 0.07) whereas in the HCV-RNA-ve mothers the cytokine values in the peripheral blood remained unchanged (however this does not mean that such differences do not exist in the placenta, decidua and umbilical cord). Furthermore, the HCV-RNA+ve mothers had higher cytokine levels than the HCV-RNA-ve mothers, both at delivery and 3–6 months post-partum. On the other hand, in the HCV-RNA+ve mothers there was no significant association between cytokine levels and IL28B polymorphism (CC vs non-CC) or between cytokine levels and viral genotype [geno. 1 (1a vs 1b) and vs geno. non-1 (3 and 4)].

Variations in ALT levels in HCV-RNA+ve mothers: Type-A and Type-B women
Not all the HCV-RNA+ve mothers presented the same patterns with respect to the parameters analysed. Therefore, and as described in the Experimental Procedures section, these women were categorized as either Type-A (59/89; 66%): raised serum ALT levels in the post-partum period (ALT3–6 months post-partum>40 U/L and an average increase in ALT level calculated as ΔALT = ALT3–6 months post-partum–ALTpartum = 100±7 U/L; P<0.001), or Type-B (30/89; 34%): unchanged ALT values (ALTpostpartum≤40 U/L) (Figure 1A). The Type-A women, at 7–12 months post-partum, presented a significant decrease in ALT values (ΔALT = ALT3–6 months post-partum–ALT7–12 months post-partum = 70.52±10.49 U/L; P<0.01). Interestingly, the Type-B mothers had a similar ALT pattern to that presented by the HCV-RNA-ve women (Figure 1A). Characteristics of the Type-A and Type-B mothers
The characteristics of the Type-A and B mothers are described in Table 1. Some clinical characteristics, such as median age, viral genotype, IL28B polymorphism, type of birth, breast-fed infants, breast-feeding days, epidemiology, gestational age, etc., were similar, but important features that might account for the categorization in each case were also found; thus, 38/59 (64%) of the Type-A mothers had high HCV viral load at delivery (>600,000 IU/mL) in contrast to 10/30 (33%) of the Type-B women (P = 0.01). Furthermore, the Type-A mothers presented a significantly lower viral load after delivery than the Type-B mothers (ΔVL = VL 3–6 months post-partum–VLpartum = -2.438.867±643.942 IU/mL vs. 11.288±664.352 IU/mL respectively; P = 0.031). Another interesting aspect is the relation between cytokine levels and type of mother (Table 1 and Figure 1B). Thus, the Type-A mothers at 3–6 months post-partum presented higher values for INFγ, IL12 and IL2 (Th1 cytokine), as well as for IL10 (Th2 and anti-inflammatory cytokine). The largest such increases took place in the Th1 cytokines INFγ and IL2. It is known that before and during delivery, the levels of oestradiol and progesterone may vary. In order to determine the possible effect on cytokine production, we studied the Th1/Th2 cytokines in the control group (HCV-RNA-ve mothers). No partum effect was detected (Figure 1B), and therefore whatever change took place in the female hormones during the intra-partum period had no effect on cytokine production. On the other hand, the Type-B mothers did not show this cytokine behaviour pattern and no statistically significant data were obtained. These Type-B mothers had higher INFγ and IL2 levels at the moment of delivery than did the HCV-RNA-ve and Type-A mothers (Th1 cytokines, Figure 1B, P>0.05).

ALT and HCV viral load evolution in both types of HCV-RNA+ve pregnant women
Analysis of ALT and HCV viral load revealed a temporal correlation among the Type-A mothers (Figure 2); ALT levels had increased and the viral load had decreased at 3–6 months post-partum (Figure S1; P<0.0001; Pearson's R = −0.740). However, the Type-B women did not present this correlation (Figure S1; P = 0.234; Pearson's R = 0.234) Furthermore, analysis of the HCV viral load in the Type-A women (Figure S2) showed that both in the mothers with high HCV-RNA viral load (>600,000 IU/mL) and in those with low HCV-RNA levels at delivery (≤600,000 IU/mL), there was a significant decrease in the HCV viral load. This post-partum decrease was independent of the HCV-RNA values at delivery. However, the Type-A women, whether with high or low viral load at delivery, presented raised INFγ, IL12 and IL2 levels post-partum (compared with the partum values, Th1 cytokines, Figure S3) and higher levels of IL10 (Th2 and anti-inflammatory cytokines). These data suggest that the cytokine behaviour pattern has a stronger influence on ALT evolution at delivery and 3–6 months post-partum than does the viral load at the same times. On the other hand, the Type-B women classified according to viral load at delivery did not present this behaviour pattern with respect to the evolution of cytokine levels in the peripheral blood.

HCV vertical transmission
The analysis of cytokine levels at delivery did not reveal any statistically significant association with HCV vertical transmission (HCV-VT). The categorization of mothers into Types-A and B showed that of the 15 infants suffering vertically transmitted HCV, 12 were born of Type-A mothers and only 3 of Type-B mothers; nevertheless, the difference was not statistically significant (Table 1 and Figure 3). Interestingly, when we categorized the Type-A and Type-B mothers in accordance with their viral load values (high or low), the Type-B mothers with low viral load had the lowest probability of HCV vertical transmission (5% in comparison to 20% in the rest of the HCV-RNA+ve women, Figure 3). In relation to chronically HCV-infected children, only two infants were HCV-RNA+ve at the end of the study (2 of the 89 children were born of HCV-RNA+ve mothers, 2.2%) and no statistically significant data were obtained. It is noteworthy that the IL28B genotype observed in the two chronically HCV-infected infants was non-CC.

In our study cohort, several spontaneous HCV clearances [4 of the 89 women (4.4%)] were observed, at 3–6 months after delivery (Table S2), but the factors involved are unknown. Three of these four women had low viral load and IL28B genotype non-TT (two women were CC and one was CT). In this respect, no differences were detected between Type-A and Type-B mothers. One mother suffered a relapse some months after the spontaneous clearance.
The aim of this study was to determine ALT evolution in women with chronic hepatitis C during the third trimester of gestation, at delivery and in the post-partum period, as a natural model of immune modulation and reconstitution; accordingly, we analysed the relations between serum ALT levels, the HCV-RNA viral load and Th1/Th2 cytokine production.To date, only a few studies, with small sample populations, have considered the evolution of HCV during both pregnancy and the post-delivery period. Therefore, much remains unknown in this respect. Our study addresses this issue using a representative cohort of HCV-RNA+ve and HCV-RNA-ve pregnant women. The cohort was monitored in regular follow-ups, from the third trimester of gestation until one year after delivery. In the HCV-RNA+ve mothers, during the third trimester of gestation and at delivery, non-significant differences in ALT values were observed. Moreover, the ALT values presented were analogous with those for the HCV-RNA-ve mothers (ALT≤40 U/L). These data are in accordance with the findings of Gervais et al. [26] and Paternoster et al. [27], who reported decreased ALT levels in serum during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy until normal ALT values (ALT≤40 U/L), together with a corresponding increase in HCV-RNA levels. We show that not all HCV-RNA+ve mothers present the same behaviour patterns in the puerperium for the parameters analysed (essentially, the ALT levels). For this reason, the women were classified into two groups: Type-A (66%) with increased ALT levels in the post-partum period, and Type-B (34%), with no variation in these ALT values. To account for these differences, we evaluated HCV-RNA and Th1/Th2 cytokine levels in the peripheral blood. The Type-A mothers presented a significant decrease in serum HCV-RNA levels in the post-partum period, and this event was concomitant with an increase in Th1 cytokine levels. Moreover, in the HCV-RNA+ve mothers as well as in each of the two subgroups (Types A and B), there was no significant association between the HCV viral genotype vs. the ALT and vs. cytokine levels. On the other hand, Lin et al. [28], in a study of ten pregnant women, and Hattori [29], who studied 22 pregnant women, found that HCV-RNA levels tend to decrease in the post-partum period. However, neither of these studies provided a definitive immune interpretation of these events. It has been widely reported that in the general population (but not among pregnant women with chronic HCV), the Th1 response is related to viral clearance and treatment response, while that of Th2 is related to HCV chronicity [30]. Thus, in the Th1 immune response against HCV, the IL12 released from dendritic cells promotes a cell-mediated response, eliciting a secretion of INF-gamma by NK and T cells. This event favours neutrophil and macrophage recruitment and provokes an inflammatory response. Therefore, the post-delivery stimulation of Th1 immune-response observed in the Type-A women may explain the decrease in HCV-RNA viral load and the increase in the ALT levels as the result of a hepatic injury. In our opinion, this period may be an optimal time to initiate antiviral treatment in Type-A women who failed to respond to previous treatment, because this Th1 re-stimulation might augment their natural defence mechanisms. IL10 is a potent anti-inflammatory Th2 cytokine, mainly produced by monocytes, macrophages and T cells, and it is capable of inhibiting the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-γ and IL-2. Moreover, it has been reported that increased levels of IL-4 can promote the conversion of macrophages into an M2 phenotype (also termed repair macrophages or anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages) and inhibit the activation of M1 macrophages (inflammatory M1 macrophages). Increased levels of repair macrophages (M2) are associated with the secretion of IL-10 and TGF-β, which reduce pathological inflammation [31]. Consequently, we consider that the slight increase in IL10 (P = 0.03) and in IL4 (non-significant, P>0.05), might be an attempt to reduce the intense inflammatory response triggered by Th1 cytokines. These data suggest that treatment with Th1 cytokines might have beneficial results in HCV therapy. Currently, only INF-alpha is used in the treatment of chronic viral hepatitis because the effectiveness of the exogenous administration of IL12, IL2 and IL10 is unclear [30]. On the other hand, in the HCV-RNA-ve mothers the cytokine values in the peripheral blood remained unchanged because the mothers' immunity was not stimulated in response to HCV.In the present study, the Type-B mothers were studied in detail. These women presented no variations in any of the parameters analysed and appeared to react as “immune-tolerant” to HCV (women with non-significant differences in their viral load values, together with persistently normal ALT levels). However, when we analysed the Th1/Th2 cytokine production, our initial opinion was modified, because surprisingly, the Type-B women were found to have a stimulated immune system with high levels of INF-γ and IL-2 (Th1 cytokines) both before and after delivery. Interestingly, several studies of the general population of chronically HCV infected persons have reported high baseline levels of Th1 cytokines (IL-2, INF-γ and TNF-α) and the expression of interferon-stimulated genes, together with an absence of post-treatment variation in the serum of patients without sustained viral response (non-SVR) [32]–[35]. We consider that in the Type-B mothers, as in non-SVR patients, the activation of the endogenous Th1 system is unable to reduce the levels of the HCV infection and that this may be associated with an ineffective or exhausted antiviral response. However, the biological mechanism responsible for the high baseline expression remains unclear. Recent studies have suggested that baseline expression is associated with IL28B polymorphism [36], [37], although others have concurred with us in finding no such association [38], [39].In relation to the vertical transmission of HCV, no relation was observed with Th1/Th2 cytokine levels in the peripheral blood. These data are in accordance with the findings of Paternoster et al., who reported that the levels of endogenous interferon-alpha during pregnancy were not related to the vertical transmission of HCV [40]. However, it was recently reported that the placenta constitutes an active innate immunological organ that provides antiviral protection against HCV transmission [41]. These authors described several locally acting mechanisms in HCV-exposed placenta, such as the increased production of cytokines by NK cells (IFN-β, SLPI, etc.) and the cytotoxicity triggered by NK T cells [41], which protect the foetus against HCV. These data might complement those observed at the systemic level (modulation in the Th1 immune response). Further studies are needed to better understand the complexities of the immune system during the pregnancy and its relation with the vertical transmission of HCV. We identified a group of pregnant women with the lowest HCV-VT rate. These mothers were characterized by low viral load and by the absence of any increase in ALT levels after delivery. These findings are in accordance with those of previous studies, which have identified the main risk factors for perinatal mother-to-child transmission of HCV as the high concentration of HCV-RNA in maternal blood and HIV co-infection [25]. Two studies have shown that high ALT levels in the serum during pregnancy and at delivery are associated with higher rates of HCV-VT [42], [43]. Due to the low number of chronically HCV-infected children in our study cohort, no statistically significant data in this respect were obtained; nevertheless, an interesting point was that the IL28B genotype observed in the two chronically HCV-infected infants was non-CC, a finding that is in accordance with our own previously published data [24].All retrospective analyses have inherent limitations, but we have tried to minimize these effects. The standard method of HCV determination was modified during the patient inclusion period, but this factor was controlled by using the same PCR technique (HCV Ampliprep TaqMan, Roche Molecular System) on all the patients studied, using a stored blood sample. The standard care procedure for HIV and HCV patients was also modified during the patient inclusion period; however, in this study the risk factors for the HIV-ve mothers (Study Cohort) were identified. According to standard protocols for HCV-RNA+ve pregnant women, no HCV treatment should be applied during pregnancy, and thus the changes in standard care for HCV patients do not affect our study.In conclusion, the different values for ALT (in the post-partum period) and HCV-RNA (at delivery and in the post-partum period) observed in the HCV-RNA+ve women might be due to different ratios of Th1 cytokine production. Thus, the Type-A mothers presented a significant decrease in serum HCV-RNA levels in the post-partum period and this event was concomitant with an increase in Th1 cytokine levels. On the other hand, in the Type B women, the high levels of Th1 cytokines observed at delivery, together with the unchanged levels of ALT and HCV-RNA post-partum, may be related to the existence of permanent Th1 cytokine stimulation. Finally, the cytokine values in the HCV-RNA-ve mothers did not change, because their immunity was not stimulated against HCV. The findings of this study could enhance our understanding of the natural history of chronic hepatitis C infection during pregnancy and the puerperium, and help identify mothers at low risk of vertical HCV infection, which would be useful for the development of prevention strategies."
