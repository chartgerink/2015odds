"NKG2D Expression on CD56+CD3+ Lymphocytes in HCV Genotype 1 Infection is Significantly Impaired
PBMCs from patients of chronic HCV infection were isolated and analyzed for the surface expression of NKG2D by flow cytometry. The two groups of patients with HCV genotype 1 and 2 infection showed no statistical significant differences in age, gender, fibrotic stages or other characteristics (Table 1). NKG2D-expressing cells were gated as CD56+CD3− (NK cells), CD56+CD3+, and CD56−CD3+CD8+ (CTL) cells from the side-scatter low lymphocyte compartment, respectively (Fig 1). No significant differences in peripheral blood frequency of total T cells, NK cells, CD56+CD3+ lymphocytes were observed between genotype 1 and genotype 2 infections. NKG2D expression levels on CD56+CD3+ lymphocytes were significantly impaired in patients with HCV genotype 1 infection, compared to genotype 2 (Fig 1D, left). A similar tendency was observed with CD8+ T cells. However, between genotypes, no significant difference was observed in NK2GD expression on NK cells (Fig 1D). Furthermore, NKG2D expression on CD56+CD3+ lymphocytes did not correlate with age, HCV-RNA levels, or status of clinical liver fibrosis as assessed by blood platelet count and serum type 4 collagen 7s levels (Fig 2). Significantly different degrees of NKG2D expression induced by different HCV genotypes were noticed on CD56+CD3+ lymphocytes or on CD8+ T cells, but not on NK cells. 10.1371/journal.pone.0125664.g002

PBMCs were collected and analyzed by flow cytometry for expression of NKG2D on CD56+CD3+ lymphocytes. Statistics of data including age, HCV-RNA, peripheral platelet count, and serum type IV collagen 7s levels were analyzed for correlation. Please refer to supporting S1 Table for detailed values. Association of Differential NKG2D Expression on CD56+CD3+ Lymphocytes from Chronic Genotype 1 Infection and Other Known Predictive Factors
Since NKG2D expression on CD56+CD3+ lymphocytes differed between genotypes 1 and 2 (Fig 1C), and showed a differential range of expression in genotype 1, we hypothesized that NKG2D expression on CD56+CD3+ lymphocytes may correlate with treatment response. Thus, we attempted to identify whether any correlation with other known predictive factors exist, including IL28B polymorphism [30, 31], ISDR amino acid mutations [24, 32, 36], and core protein substitution at aa70 or aa91 [33]. Of fifty-three patients with genotype 1 infection included in this study, IL28B SNPs at rs8099917, mutation numbers of ISDR on NS5A (aa2209-aa2248) and core protein mutation at aa70 or aa91 were determined. In this cohort, NKG2D expression on CD56+CD3+ lymphocytes showed no difference when stratified by IL28B SNPs (major vs. minor) or ISDR mutation numbers (≤1 vs. ≥2). However, a significant difference when stratified by core protein determination at aa70 and aa91 (double wild-type or not, Fig 3) was noticed. This implies that differential NKG2D expression on CD56+CD3+ lymphocytes in chronic genotype 1 infection might be more prominently influenced viral structural proteins, especially the differences in core proteins, rather than host factors. 10.1371/journal.pone.0125664.g003

Cases of HCV genotype 1 infection were determined for the IL28B SNP polymorphism at rs8099917, mutation numbers of ISDR on NS5A (aa2209-aa2248) and core protein substitution at aa70 or aa91 before treatment. NKG2D expression on CD56+CD3+ lymphocytes was compared between IL28B genotype major (TT at rs8099917, n = 35) or minor (TG or GG, n = 18), ISDR mutation numbers ≤1 (n = 34) or ≥2 (= 19), aa70 substituted (subs, n = 17) or wild type (n = 36), aa91 substituted (n = 19) or wild type (n = 34), double wild type (DWT, n = 25) at aa70 and aa91 or non-double wild type (nDWT, n = 27). Data show mean ± SD. **P < 0.01. NS: not significant. Ex vivo Exposure with Different Genotypes of HCV Strains Induced Genotype-specific Decrease of NKG2D Expression on CD56+CD3+ Lymphocytes
As previously described, different genotypes of HCV may influence NKG2D expression on CD56+CD3+ lymphocytes, and may related to structural proteins. Here we used two different strains of HCV genotypes, JHF1 (genotype 2a) and TNS2J1, a chimeric strain of genotype 1b in structural areas and 2a in non-structural areas (Fig 4A), and co-incubate them in vitro with PBMCs from healthy donors. We used whole isolated PBMCs because there is sufficient evidence that immune cells showed interactions between antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells are important in sensing viral particles [21]. Using Huh7.5 hepatoma cell line as the control, NKG2D expression on CD56+CD3+ lymphocytes was significantly decreased in the TNS2J1 group, but not in the JFH1 group. This phenomenon was not observed on NK cells (Fig 4B and 4C). In CD8 T lymphocytes, NKG2D expression decreased when co-incubated with both HCV strains; however, this was not statistically significant compared with the group co-incubated with Huh7.5 supernatants (Fig 4C). 10.1371/journal.pone.0125664.g004

Since HCV genotype 1 infection is more difficult to eradicate with interferon-based therapies than genotype 2, we further investigated whether CD56+CD3+ lymphocytes bearing different NKG2D expressing levels influenced the treatment effect of PEG-IFN/ ribavirin therapy. Thirty patients, including 17 with genotype 1 HCV infection and 13 with genotype 2, were analyzed. PBMCs were isolated and analyzed for NKG2D expression prior to the start of treatment. Regardless of genotype differences, NKG2D expression on CD56+CD3+ lymphocytes was highly and significantly correlated to the degree of HCV-RNA reduction from week 0 to week 4 (ΔHCV-RNA0-4w; correlation coefficient, 0.81; P < 0.0001, Fig 5A, left). When stratified by RVR or not, cases that developed RVR showed significantly higher NKG2D expression on CD56+CD3+ lymphocytes than non-RVR cases (Fig 5A, right). 10.1371/journal.pone.0125664.g005

PBMCs were collected and analyzed by flow cytometry for NKG2D expression on CD56+CD3+ lymphocytes before treatment. Plasma HCV-RNA levels were measured regularly to monitor viral kinetics during treatment. (A, left) Correlation of decreased plasma HCV RNA (IU/ml) from week 0 to week 4 and NKG2D expression on CD56+CD3+ lymphocytes is shown. (A, right) NKG2D expression was analyzed to compare RVR (n = 8) and non-RVR (n = 22) cases. (B) NKG2D expression on CD56+CD3+ lymphocytes was analyzed to (i) compare SVR (n = 17) and non-SVR (n = 13) cases; (ii) SVR (n = 4), PR (n = 9), and NR (n = 4) in genotype 1 infection; (iii) ROC analysis to predict SVR by NKG2D expression on CD56+CD3+ lymphocytes. (C) Pre-treatment peripheral CD56+CD3+ lymphocytes were stratified into CD4+CD8-, CD8+CD4- and CD4-CD8- double negative (DN) subpopulations. NKG2D expression on corresponding subpopulations were determined. Statistics of NKG2D expression were compared between SVR (n = 17) and non-SVR (n = 13) cases, including both genotypes. Data show mean ± SD. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, NS: not significant. Significant differences of NKG2D expression on CD56+CD3+ lymphocytes between SVR and non-SVR cases were also observed (Fig 5B-i). When limited to cases of genotype 1, NKG2D expression on CD56+CD3+ lymphocytes from SVR cases was significantly higher than PR or NR (Fig 5B-ii). ROC analysis revealed that NKG2D expression on CD56+CD3+ lymphocytes above 0.80 could predict SVR by PEG-IFN/ ribavirin therapy with a high probability (area under the curve 0.95; Fig 5B-iii). Because NKG2D expression on CD8+ T cells also showed significant difference between HCV genotypes as showed in Fig 1D, we did ROC analysis of NKG2D expression on CD8+ T cells for the prediction of SVR in the same cohort of cases. The area under curve was 0.76 (ROC curve not shown), and was inferior to that of NKG2D expression on CD56+CD3+ lymphocytes.
The pre-treatment NKG2D expression of peripheral CD56+CD3+ lymphocyte subpopulations, ie, CD8+CD4-, CD4+CD8-, or CD4-CD8- double negative (DN) was also analyzed. Higher pre-treatment NKG2D expression of CD8+CD4- subpopulation significantly associated to SVR (Fig 5C). Impaired NKG2D Expression on CD56+CD3+ Lymphocytes Correlates to Decreased IFN-γ Production
IFN-γ-mediated killing of HCV-infected hepatocytes is a mechanism of immune-mediated eradication of HCV infection [2, 37], and NKG2D is the receptor for the MICA/MICB pathway that induces IFN-γ production [9]. Therefore, differences of NKG2D expression on CD56+CD3+ lymphocytes that exist between genotypes and within genotype 1 might explain the inferior immunological response. In previous studies, CD56+CD3+ lymphocytes produce more IFN-γ upon activation, compared to NK cells [14] and CD56 negative T cells [37, 38]. To investigate whether differential NKG2D expression within genotype 1 infections on CD56+CD3+ lymphocytes influences IFN-γ production, we analyzed IFN-γ production from CD56+CD3+ lymphocytes after stimulation by PMA/ionomycin (gating strategy in Fig 6A), a known strong stimulator of human peripheral blood CD56+CD3+ lymphocytes [39]. Compared to NK cells, the frequency of IFN-γ- producing CD56+CD3+ lymphocytes was higher within population. Of 14 cases of genotype 1 infection enrolled in this experiment, higher NKG2D expression on CD56+CD3+ lymphocytes significantly correlated with higher IFN-γ production (Fig 6B; correlation coefficient, 0.89; P < 0.0001). However, NKG2D expression on CD56+CD3- NK cells showed no significant correlation with IFN-γ production. 10.1371/journal.pone.0125664.g006
Fig 6 Impaired NKG2D expression on CD56+CD3+ lymphocytes correlates to decreased IFN-γ production.
PBMC were collected and analyzed for surface NKG2D expression by flow cytometry in fourteen chronically HCV genotype 1 infected cases. With the same blood sample and at the same time, 4 hours of PMA/ionomycin stimulations were introduced, and then intracellular IFN-γ production levels were determined in CD56+CD3+ (NKT), CD56+CD3- (NK) and CD56-CD3+ (T lymphocyte) populations. (A) Two representative FACS plots and histograms are from the case of SVR (upper) and non-SVR (lower). CD56+ cells are shown as red dots, and other cells as gray dots. n = 14. Statistical correlation of corresponding NKG2D expression and IFN-i production was analyzed in (B). The current study demonstrates that NKG2D expression on CD56+CD3+ lymphocytes, rather than on CD56+CD3− NK cells, is significantly reduced in chronic HCV genotype 1 infection. NKG2D expression on CD56+CD3+ lymphocytes correlates significantly with HCV viral kinetics in the early phase of PEG-IFN/ ribavirin therapy, and predicts treatment responses.Intrahepatic NKT cells, defined by lymphocytes having both T cell and NK cell surface markers, from HCV-infected individuals showed dysregulated expression of killer immunoglobulin-like receptors [40]. Golden-Mason at al. indicated that inhibitory NKG2A is upregulated in CD56+CD3+ lymphocytes in acute HCV infection, and showed a positive correlation of inhibitory NKG2A expression on CD56+CD3+ lymphocytes to HCV viral load from month 0 and month 6 after infection [41]. Werner et al. showed increased NKG2D expression on peripheral CD1d-restricted NKT cells as part of the innate immune response to acute HCV exposure in healthcare workers who did not develop acute hepatitis [42]. Our current study reveals a not-yet-told correlation of genotype-associated chronicity of HCV persistence with NKG2D expression on CD56+CD3+ lymphocytes. This is the first to specify a single group of immune cells influenced by HCV genotype difference, and may provide an explanation to the natural history of HCV infection.We also emphasized that the CD56+CD3+ lymphocyte cell subpopulation may also influence treatment response. CD8+ NKT cells exist in humans but are rare in mice [43]. In a previous study, Lin et al. revealed that human peripheral blood CD8+CD56+CD3+ lymphocytes from healthy donors may up-regulate cytotoxic-related surface antigens such as CD16 and NKG2D upon stimulation [44]. Kuylenstierna et al. showed that human peripheral NKT cells express NKG2D almost exclusively on the CD4 negative counterpart, and NKG2D-expressing CD4 negative NKT cells can be activated through NKG2D in a CD1d-independent fashion [11]. On the other hand, it has also been noticed that conventional CD8+ T cells with variant TCRs express NK cell markers upon activation, especially during chronic viral infections such as HIV or CMV [12]. Altogether, though the origin of NKG2D-expessing CD8+CD56+CD3+ lymphocytes might of some dispute, their crucial role in chronic HCV infection is evident for the first time by the current study.Regulation of NKG2D expression might be multifactorial and both influenced by the virus and the host. HCV core amino acid mutation at aa70 or aa91, a non-double wild type, is known to be predictive to treatment failure in genotype 1 infection [45]. In this study, NKG2D expression on CD56+CD3+ lymphocytes is significantly decreased in non-double wild type cases (Fig 3). We hypothesized that the HCV with different structure proteins may play roles in reduction of NKG2D expression, and this hypothesis was supported by the result of co-incubation of different HCV strains (Fig 4). The co-incubation design has limitations that both direct interaction and humeral factors contained in the supernatants could be possible. HCV infection has been reported to inhibit NK cell function through interaction with CD81 [46, 47] or by the imbalance of cytokines [21]. On the other hand, although we emphasized the genotype-associated difference in NKG2D expression, we also noticed a differential expression of NKG2D within HCV genotype 1 (Fig 1D). Our result didn’t support significant correlation with IL28B polymorphisms, however, we cannot rule out the possibility of correlation to other host factors, such as IFNL4 polymorphisms, which has been reported by Jouvin-Marche et al. about the correlation of favorable genotype with higher early HCV viral load reduction during PEG-IFN/ ribavirin treatment [48]. Recently, Fernandez-Sanchez et al. showed epigenetic modification of histone acetylation determines NKG2D gene expression in NK cells and CTLs in vitro [49], and Quan et al. revealed that HCV core protein may influence this process [50]. Sato et al. showed that inhibition of histone deacetylase suppresses HCV replication [51]. López-Rodríguez et al. found that histone deacetylase polymorphism helps predict IFN-based HCV treatment response [52]. Thus, epigenetic modification of NKG2D expression by HCV proteins may be one possible mechanism. Whether these viral or host factors work on CD56+CD3+ lymphocytes is still unknown, and needs to be further studied.Type I interferon response are impaired in chronic HCV infection [2, 4], however, exogenous administration of interferon-α during treatment may help eradicate HCV through enforcement of CD56+CD3+ lymphocyte function. Though we observed changes of NKG2D expression in CD56+CD3+ lymphocytes during and after PEG-IFN/ ribavirin treatment (unpublished data), the mechanism how exogenous interferon-α work on NKG2D expression still needs further investigation.In conclusion, Decreased NKG2D expression on CD56+CD3+ lymphocytes in chronic HCV genotype 1 infection predicts inferior treatment response to PEG-IFN/ribavirin therapy compared to genotype 2. Treatment of chronic hepatitis C progresses rapidly, and IFN-free therapies are becoming new standards in clinical settings. However, analysis of NKG2D expression on peripheral CD56+CD3+ lymphocytes may provide better stratification of treatable patients with genotype 1 infection who may not be suitable for direct-antiviral agents. Furthermore, the better understanding of the mechanisms how HCV interacts with host immunity may provide some hints for possible treatment to HCV infections and its related complications."
