"Patient Characteristics and Treatment Outcome All patients in our test cohort were infected with HCV genotype 1b. Of the 115 patients receiving PEG-IFN-α2b and ribavirin therapy, 56 (49%) achieved an SVR. The remaining 59 patients were non-responders, 28 of whom experienced a relapse and 31 who were null responders. The median white blood cell count (P = 0.011) and hemoglobin value (P = 0.002) in the SVR group were significantly higher than those in the non-SVR group prior to treatment. HCV viral load at baseline was significantly associated with treatment outcome (P < 0.001). Association of HLA and KIR with a Sustained Virological Response We first determined the frequency of HLA-Bw and HLA-C alleles in SVR and non-SVR patients (Figure 1). The frequency of HLA-Bw4Bw6 in responders was significantly higher than that in non-responders (55% [31/56] vs. 36% [21/59]; P = 0.033; OR = 2.24, 95% CI = 1.06 - 4.75). Conversely, patients with the HLA-Bw6 homozygote had a higher non-SVR rate (32% [18/56] vs. 54% [32/59]; P = 0.017; OR = 0.40, 95% CI = 0.19 - 0.85). Overall, HLA-Bw4 was associated with an SVR among patients (68% [38/56] vs. 46% [27/59]; P = 0.017; OR = 2.50, 95% CI = 1.17 - 5.35). The frequencies of HLA-C were not statistically significant. We further checked whether particular HLA-Bw or HLA-C alleles were beneficial to treatment outcome. The HLA-B*35:01 allele was more frequently found in patients with an SVR than in those without (13% [15/102] vs. 4% [5/118]; P = 0.014 [Pc = 0.36]; OR = 3.49, 95% CI = 1.23 - 9.97). 10.1371/journal.pone.0083381.g001Figure 1 Frequency of HLA-Bw and -C alleles in 56 patients with a sustained virological response (SVR) and 59 patients with a non-SVR to pegylated interferon and ribavirin therapy of chronic hepatitis C. The distribution of KIR genes and their association with treatment outcome are shown in Figure 2. No statistically significant differences were found for any allele combination apart from KIR2DL2 and KIR2DS2; patients with these genes had significantly decreased SVR frequencies compared with those without (P = 0.015 [Pc = 0.48]; OR = 0.30, 95% CI = 0.11 - 0.82 and P = 0.025 [Pc = 0.8]; OR = 0.32, 95% CI = 0.12 - 0.90, respectively). 10.1371/journal.pone.0083381.g002Figure 2 Frequency of each KIR gene in 56 patients with a sustained virological response (SVR) and 59 patients with a non-SVR to pegylated interferon and ribavirin therapy of chronic hepatitis C. KIR genotype profiles were determined by the presence or absence of each KIR locus in patients (Figure 3). Since strong linkage disequilibrium is a prominent feature in the KIR region, KIR gene profiles were classified based on Cen and Tel motifs. When we evaluated SVR according to genotype and Cen and Tel frequencies, we observed that virologic clearance with Cen-A/A was significantly higher than that without (54% [50/92] vs. 26% [6/23], P = 0.015; OR = 3.37, 95% CI = 1.22 - 9.33). There were no significant differences regarding AA genotype and Tel. 10.1371/journal.pone.0083381.g003Figure 3 KIR gene profile frequencies in 56 patients with a sustained virological response (SVR) and 59 patients with a non-SVR to pegylated interferon and ribavirin therapy of chronic hepatitis C.Numerical data represent the number of individuals (%). The presence of KIR genes is indicated by gray shading. Cen, centromeric; Tel, telomeric.  We next analyzed combinations of activation/inhibitory KIRs and their HLA ligands for possible associations with an SVR. Among the combinations of KIR3DL1-HLA-Bw4, KIR2DL2-HLA-C1, and KIR2DL1-HLA-C2, patients who carried the inhibitory KIR3DL1 receptor and its ligand HLA-Bw4 had a significantly higher response rate than those without KIR3DL1 or HLA-Bw4 (58% [36/62] vs. 38% [20/53]; P = 0.030 [Pc = 0.12]; OR = 2.29, 95% CI = 1.08 - 4.84). In contrast, the KIR2DL2-HLA-C1 combination resulted in a significantly lower SVR rate (26% [6/23] vs. 54% [50/92]; P = 0.015 [Pc = 0.06]; OR = 0.30, 95% CI = 0.11 - 0.82). Although several studies have found that KIR2DL3-HLA-C1 carriers are associated with treatment-induced and spontaneous clearance of HCV in Caucasians, no such association was found in our cohort (data not shown). Patients with KIR3DL1-HLA-Bw4 but without KIR2DL2-HLA-C1 had a higher SVR rate (55% [31/56] vs. 32% [19/59]; P = 0.012 [Pc = 0.1]; OR = 2.61, 95% CI = 1.22 - 5.58) (Table 2). Conversely, the frequency of the KIR2DL2-HLA-C1 positive, but KIR3DL1-HLA-Bw4 negative condition was significantly higher in non-responders (17% [10/59] vs. 2% [1/56]; P = 0.014 [Pc = 0.12]; OR = 0.09, 95% CI = 0.01 - 0.72).   Prediction of a Sustained Virological Response by KIR-HLA and IL28B Examination of the IL28B rs8099917 SNP in our cohort revealed significant differences in SVR frequencies. The SVR rate in patients with the IL28B TT genotype was significantly higher in those with TG or GG genotypes (62% [44/71] vs. 27% [12/44), P = 0.0003; OR = 4.35, 95% CI = 1.92 - 9.85). In subjects with IL28B TT and KIR3DL1-HLABw4, virologic clearance was significantly increased over other combinations (68% [27/40] vs. 39% [29/75]; P = 0.003 [Pc = 0.024]; OR 3.29, 95% CI = 1.47 - 7.39). We next evaluated several factors found in association with an SVR to PEG-IFN and ribavirin therapy for independence by logistic regression analysis. Fifty-six responders were compared with 59 non-responders by means of a forward stepwise likelihood ratio logistic regression method; estimated OR coefficients, 95% CI, and P values are summarized in Table 3 for the variables that remained in equation at the last step. IL28B TT genotype (P = 0.00009; OR = 6.87, 95% CI = 2.62 - 18.01), KIR2DL2-HLA-C1 (P = 0.014; OR = 0.24, 95% CI = 0.08 - 0.75), white blood cell count ≥ 4410/μL (P = 0.009; OR = 3.32, 95% CI= 1.35 - 8.16), and KIR3DL1-HLA-Bw4 (P = 0.008; OR = 3.32, 95% CI = 1.37 - 8.05) were all identified as independent parameters that significantly influenced an SVR.  10.1371/journal.pone.0083381.t003Table 3 Logistic regression analysis of variables contributing to a sustained virological response to pegylated interferon and ribavirin. Factor Odds ratio 95% confidence interval P IL28B TT genotype 6.87 2.62 - 18.01 0.00009 KIR2DL2/HLA-C1 0.24 0.08 - 0.75 0.014 White blood cells ≥ 4410/μL 3.32 1.35 - 8.16 0.009 KIR3DL1/HLA-Bw4 3.32 1.37 - 8.05 0.008 Only variables achieving statistical significance (P < 0.05) in multivariate logistic regression analysis are shown. The frequency of the IL28B TT genotype with KIR3DL1-HLA-Bw4 in responders was significantly higher than in non-responders (48% [27/56] vs. 22% [13/59]; P = 0.003 [Pc = 0.024]; OR = 3.29, 95% CI = 1.47 - 7.39) (Table 2). Patients with the IL28B TT genotype without KIR2DL2-HLA-C1 had a significantly higher SVR rate (68% [38/56] vs. 31% [18/59]; P = 0.000062 [Pc = 0.0005]; OR = 4.81, 95% CI = 2.19 - 10.58). The frequency of a non-SVR was significantly higher in patients with the IL28B non-TT genotype both with and without KIR2DL2-HLA-C1 (14% [8/59] vs. 0% [0/8]; P = 0.013 [Pc = 0.1] and 41% [24/59] vs. 21% [12/56]; P = 0.026 [Pc = 0.21]; OR = 0.40, 95% CI = 0.17 - 0.91, respectively). The ability to predict an SVR by IL28B genotype and KIR3DL1-HLA-Bw4 and KIR2DL2-HLA-C1 was next evaluated. Corresponding values for sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV are listed in Table S1 in File S1. A combination of the IL28B TT genotype and KIR3DL1-HLA-Bw4 demonstrated high predictive specificity (78%), as did the combination of IL28B TT genotype and KIR2DL2-HLA-C1 (86%). Lastly, we analyzed combinations of the three factors of IL28B genotype, KIR3DL1-HLA-Bw4, and KIR2DL2-HLA-C1 for prediction of treatment outcome (Table S2 in File S1). The frequencies of IL28B TT, KIR2DL2-HLA-C1-negative, with and without KIR3DL1-HLA-Bw4 were significantly higher among responders (38% [21/56] vs. 19% [11/59]; P = 0.024 [Pc = 0.29]; OR = 2.62, 95% CI = 1.12 - 6.12 and 30% [17/56] vs. 12% [7/59]; P = 0.015 [Pc = 0.18]; OR = 3.24, 95% CI = 1.22 - 8.57, respectively). The present study examined HLA, KIR, and IL28B gene variant associations with an SVR following PEG-IFN and ribavirin therapy in Japanese patients with chronic hepatitis C. We found a significant association of HLA-Bw alleles with treatment outcome, although the frequency of HLA-C alleles did not differ significantly between responders and non-responders. Functional analyses have demonstrated that NK cells in HLA-C1C1 subjects exhibit a more rapid and stronger antiviral response that those in HLA-C2C2 subjects due to differing responses of HLA-C-inhibited NK subsets[33]. HLA-C2C2 homozygousity is strongly associated with treatment failure in HCV patients of European ancestry [11,22], but we could not assess its role in our study because this genotype was found in only 1 of 115 patients. 	We uncovered a significant association between the presence of KIR2DL2 or KIR2DS2 and lower SVR rates. Several reports have shown that KIR2DL3-HLAC1 in Caucasians [11,22] and KIR2DL5 in Brazilians [34] are associated with treatment outcome of antiviral therapy. Since our results showed no such statistical significances, these conflicting interpretations may reflect differences in patient selection, genetic background, sample size, and/or treatment regimen. Further studies are required to clarify this discrepancy in the Japanese population.	A study by Dring et al. examined KIR haplotypes in patients with HCV infection and showed that a centromeric KIR haplotype was increased in chronic HCV infection as compared with resolved cases [20]. We therefore determined KIR haplotypes and Cen-A/B and Tel-A/B in our patients as well, and found an interesting association between Cen-A/A and an SVR to antiviral therapy (P = 0.015; OR 3.37). Since Cen-A/B is determined by KIR2DL3 and KIR2DS2 and/or KIR2DL2, this finding is consistent with our results demonstrating a relationship between KIR2DS2 and KIR2DL2 genotypes and treatment failure. 	The most significant finding in this study was the association between KIR-HLA receptor-ligand pairings and treatment outcome in chronic hepatitis C. Among the inhibitory KIR-HLA receptor-ligand pairs, patients with KIR3DL1-HLA-Bw4 exhibited a significantly higher SVR rate when compared to those without this pair (P = 0.03; OR 2.29). Conversely, virologic clearance in patients with KIR2DL2-HLA-C1 was significantly lower than in those without (P = 0.015; OR = 0.30). Stratification analysis of the 4 groups of KIR3DL1-HLA-Bw4 (presence or absence) and KIR2DL2-HLA-C1 (presence or absence) revealed a higher frequency of responders with KIR3DL1-HLA-Bw4 presence, KIR2DL2-HLA-C1 absence compared with those possessing KIR2DL2-HLA-C1 presence, KIR3DL1-HLA-Bw4 absence (62% vs. 9%; P = 0.0044; OR =16.32). When these KIR-HLA pairs were both either positive or negative, SVR rates were similar at 42% and 45%, respectively. Together with the results of logistic regression analysis, we clearly showed that KIR3DL1-HLA-Bw4 was positively associated with an SVR (OR = 3.32) and that KIR2DL2-HLA-C1 had a negative association (OR = 0.24) with treatment outcome. As almost one half of the Japanese population have the functional KIR3DL1-HLA-Bw4 combination, this inhibitory receptor-ligand interaction is potentially important in understanding NK cell diversification. The NK-cell surface expression of KIR3DL1 is higher in individuals having Bw4 than in those lacking it [35]. Therefore, these cells might be more weakly controlled by inhibitory signals than other NK cells, more easily activated by viral infection, and more readily promoted for cytolysis and IFN-gamma production.	This study confirmed that the IL28B TT genotype is a strong predictor of an SVR in Japanese patients[18,32]. Furthermore, SVR frequencies were positively correlated with a combination of the IL28B TT genotype and KIR3DL1-HLA-Bw4 (P = 0.0019) and negatively associated with the IL28B TT genotype and KIR2DL2-HLA-C1 (P = 0.0067). These combinations were also highly specific for virologic response prediction. In light of these findings, patients with poor expected treatment outcome may be advised to wait for the use of combinations of direct acting antiviral agents[36]. Akuta et al. reported that a combination of amino acid substitutions in the core region of HCV and IL28B genotype was a useful predictor of PEG-IFN, ribavirin, and telaprevir therapy results in Japan[37]. Since we could not collect sera before treatment for all patients, we were not able to assess the effect of amino acid substitutions in the HCV core region. Furthermore, interferon-free combinations of direct-acting antiviral agents have become an area of considerable clinical interest. Chu et al. have reported that IL28B genotype appears to affect early viral kinetics in patients with chronic hepatitis C receiving interferon-free treatment [38]. Recently, two groups have discovered IFN lambda 4 (IFNL4), a new gene that may account for associations of spontaneous and IFN-based treatment clearance of HCV [39,40]. The IFN-λ 4 protein is generated by individuals who carry the ∆G allele of the ss469415590 variant, and the presence of this protein is strongly associated with impaired clearance of HCV. Linkage disequilibrium is strong between the IFNL4-∆G allele and the unfavorable rs12979860-T allele (IL28B) in subjects of European or Asian ancestry, whereas this linkage disequilibrium is moderate in individuals of African ancestry [39]. We have confirmed that the linkage disequilibrium between the IFNL4-∆G allele and IL28B SNP (rs8099917) is high and that the IFNL4-∆G allele is strongly associated with treatment failure of PEG-IFN and ribavirin therapy in patients with Japanese chronic hepatitis C [41]. Hence, the clinical impacts of HLA-KIR genetic variants, IL28B genotype, and the IFNL4 allele should be explored.	In conclusion, the present study showed significant associations of KIR3DL1-HLA-Bw4, KIR2DL2-HLA-C1, and IL28B combinations with an SVR to PEG-IFN and ribavirin therapy in Japanese patients with genotype 1 HCV. The clinical significance of IL28B genotyping combined with HLA/KIR pairs to predict treatment outcome warrants further validation for triple therapy."
