"Nested PCR-based distribution of GTs
Among 73 treatment-naïve samples which were subject to cDNA synthesis, 23 (31.5%) were amplified. The quantification cycle (Cq) values of 50 samples not amplified (33.91±1.55) were significantly lower than those of the 23 amplified samples (32.76±1.17) (p = 0.002). Similar to the serological prevalence, GT-1b (15 patients, 65.2%) and 2 (6 patients, 26.1%) were dominant in Koreans [46]. GT-3a and 4 were amplified in one subject each (4.3%) (Table S1). Clinical details of the GT-1b patients for whom the sequences were amplified are presented in Table S2. Phylogenetic analysis of GT-1b and its characteristics
A phylogenetic analysis based on the 492bp GT-1b sequenced NS5B region of randomly selected subclones showed distinct sequence variation between each subject (Fig. 1). All 15 subjects belonged to GT-1b. 12 subjects with N316/E464 and three subjects with C316/Q464 were phylogenetically segregated, showing high bootstrap values (75%). The C316/Q464 group had significantly lower Cq values [C316/Q464 (31.69±0.92) vs. N316/E464 (32.28±1.05), p = 0.033] and exclusively showed advanced liver disease (CH + LC + HCC) (100%) compared to the other group (48.1%, p = 0.001) at the subclonal level (Table 1, Table S3). This finding indicates a positive correlation between viral replication and the clinical severity of liver disease. The nucleotide sequence of 166 subclones is available in the GenBank nucleotide sequence databases with the following accession numbers: KF422017-KF422027.

Distribution of mutations in the sequenced NS5B region
The distribution of the mutations from the sequenced GT-1b NS5B region aa 164 is shown in Fig. 2. There were six known CD8+ T cell epitopes (Table S4) [37], [43]–[45], and the mutation frequencies inside the CD8+ T cell epitope regions (2.9%) were significantly higher than those outside the epitope regions (2.3%, p = 0.001). The mutation frequencies inside the predicted CD4+ T cell epitopes (4.8%) were significantly higher than those outside the CD4+ T cell epitope (1.4%) and were even higher than those inside the known CD8+ T cell epitopes (p<0.001) (Table S5). We designated the region including the aa 333–355 section of the CD4+ T cell epitopes as a mutational hotspot, as which an extraordinary high mutation frequency (6.7%) was observed (Fig. 2). Of note, the region was predicted to have high binding affinity for the various MHC class II HLA types prevalent in Koreans, raising the possibility that there may be distinctive MHC class II restricted immune pressure against HCV GT-1b in the mutational hotspot (Table 2).

Comparison of synonymous (dS) and nonsynonymous mutations (dN) according to the NS5B region
The distinctive CD4+ T cell-mediated immune pressure was examined by comparing dN to dS. The dN/dS ratio inside the known CD8+ T cell epitopes (0.29) was slightly higher than that of the outside (0.21) region with dN frequencies of 2.9% and 2.3%, respectively. The dN/dS ratio inside the predicted CD4+ T cell epitopes (0.49) was statistically higher than that outside (0.13), with dN frequencies of 4.8% and 1.4%, respectively, although the dS frequency outside the predicted CD4+ T cell epitopes was higher at a statistically significant level. The odds ratio of the dN inside and outside the predicted CD4+ T cell epitopes was 3.55. In the mutational hotspot, dN frequencies (11.1%) were found to be higher than dS frequencies (4.8%), resulting in an elevated dN/dS ratio (1.4). This suggests there are strong MHC class II restricted immune pressures against HCV NS5B in chronic Korean patients (Table 3).

Comparisons of dS and dN in the NS5B region between Korean patients and patients from other countries
To examine whether there was distinctive immune pressure against HCV NS5B at the CD4+ T cell level in Koreans, we compared dS and dN in the NS5B region between 15 Korean patients and 60 patients from other countries (China: 15, Japan: 15, Switzerland: 15 and the United States: 15). In the Koreans subjects, we used the consensus sequences of NS5B from more than 10 subclones of patients. For the patients from other countries, we used sequences retrieved from the LANL HCV database. In the NS5B region, the dN/dS ratio for the Korean subjects (0.23) was higher than it was for those from other countries (1.4) with statistical support (p = 0.002). The dN frequency (3.1) in the known CD8+ T cell epitopes from Korean patients was higher than that for the patients from other countries (2.1), but the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.078). However, the dN frequency (4.5%) in the predicted CD4+ T cell epitope regions in the Korean patients was significantly higher than that in those from other countries (2.2%) (p<0.001). The dN/dS ratios in the predicted CD4+ T cell epitope regions were higher in the Koreans (0.52) by nearly twofold compared to those of the patients from other areas (0.26). In particularly, the difference in the dN frequency between the Koreans (6.4%) and the patients from other countries (2.3%) was more pronounced in the mutational hotspot. Collectively, these results suggest the presence of distinctive CD4+ T cell mediated immune pressure against HCV NS5B in Koreans (Table 4).

Correlation between NS5B mutations and the severity of liver disease
The overall mutation frequency of the entire NS5B region in C (2.8%) was significantly higher than in the comparison group, patients with CH, those with liver cirrhosis LC and those with HCC (2.2%) (p = 0.002). The mutation frequency in known CD8+ T cell epitopes was also significantly higher in C than in the comparison group [C (3.4%) vs. CH + LC + HCC (2.6%), p = 0.05]. This tendency was also found in the predicted CD4+ T cell epitopes [C (5.7%) vs. CH + LC + HCC (4.2%), p = 0.001] and in the mutational hotspot [C (7.7%) vs. CH + LC + HCC (5.9%), p = 0.004] with an increased frequency of mutations at a statistically significant level. This shows that increases in the mutation rate in the NS5B region are negatively correlated with the progression of liver disease in chronic hepatitis C patients (Table 5).

Mutation frequency in codons related to SVR and ETR in Korean patients
Mutations at the 309, 333, 338 and 355 codons are reportedly related to SVR and ETR groups as compared to non-responders (NR) [15]. Interestingly, a very high mutation rate in four SVR-related codons was found in Korean treatment-naïve patients, with an average mutation frequency of 28.9% (192/664) in the quasispecies distributions. Of note, the average mutation frequency (31.7%) in four codons as calculated from 15 Korean patients was significantly higher than any of the other regions, including that from Japan (Table 6).

A quasispecies analysis showed a total of 10 mutations, including SVR and antiviral resistance in the sequenced NS5B region. These can be divided into two distinct groups. One is the diverse (D) type, which coexists with other quasispecies members in a patient, and the other is made up of conserved (C) types which exist alone without a quasispecies counterpart in a patient (Fig. 2, Table 1). The coexistence of diverse quasispecies at a specific codon may be indirect evidence of an important target for immune pressure or/and viral fitness. Notably, the coexistence of Q and R at codon 309, located in one of the CD8+ T cell epitopes (aa 308 and 315), was found in all 15 Korean subjects via a quasispecies distribution analysis; this may be due to the distinct CD8+ T cell immune pressure against a region between aa 308 and 315 among Koreans (Table S6). In addition, there were other D type mutations: A333V, S335N, V338A, P353L, E440G/K and C451H. On the other hand, there were only three C types of mutations (C316N, Q355K/R and E464Q). Interestingly, in all the three C-type mutations, significantly different Cq values between two counterparts in the respective mutation type were found (Table S3).
The presence of distinct HLA types among an ethnic group could lead to distinct MHC class I or II restricted immune pressures within its population [37], [43], [44], [47]. Therefore, the frequency and patterns of escape variants against structural and nonstructural HCV proteins reflect the background HLA types among an ethnic group [48], [49]. The aim of the present study is to investigate the background mutation frequency and patterns of HCV NS5B, reportedly related to a high SVR, from treatment-naïve Korean patients chronically infected with GT-1b in an effort to explain the high SVR in Korean patients. The significant findings of this study are discussed below.First, the entire mutation frequency in the sequenced NS5B region was positively correlated with Cs but not with patients showing disease progression (CH, LC and HCC) [C (2.8%) vs. CH + LC + HCC (2.2%), p = 0.002]. Furthermore, similar mutation frequencies were noted within both the CD4+ (p = 0.001) and CD8+ T cell epitope regions (p = 0.05) (Table 5). This suggests that the accumulation of multiple mutations in NS5B may be induced by vigorous and multi-specific immune pressure in the HCV-acute infection phase and may lead to the functional abnormality of HCV RdRp activity, resulting in the attenuation of HCV pathogenic potentials [19]. This strongly supports previous results which showed that mutations in NS5B were related to the high SVR and EVR of GT-1b chronically infected patients [15].Second, a pronounced dN frequency in the predicted CD4+ T cell epitopes in the NS5B region [Korean (4.5%) vs. those of patients from other countries (2.1%), p = 0.001], particularly in the mutational hotspot [Korean (6.4%) vs. other countries (3.1%), p = 0.01], was found in Korean patients but not in patients from other areas (Table 4). This suggests that there is distinct intrahepatic MHC class II restricted immune pressure at least against HCV NS5B among the Korean population [19]. Broadly directed virus-specific immune pressure at the CD4+ T cell level was recently reported to play a very pivotal role in spontaneous resolution at a very early phase of HCV-acute infection [50]. Furthermore, the presence of the multi-specific CD4+ T cell response against HCV can aid not only the induction of a vigorous antiviral CD8+ T cell response but also antibody production for the inhibition of the spread of the virus [51]. Particularly, because three codons (A333, V338 and Q355) out of four reported to be related to the high SVR are located in the mutational hotspot, the acquisition of mutations within this region induced by the distinctive Korean immune pressure at the CD4+ T cell level may contribute to the high SVR found in Korean patients infected with GT-1b. In fact, the prediction of the MHC class II HLA allele showed that a region of the CD4+ T cell epitope from NS5B, covering aa 333 to 347, one of two predicted epitopes comprising the mutational hotspot, has high binding affinity for most HLA DRB1 alleles prevalent in Korean populations [52]. In addition, HLA DQB1 03:01 and 03:02, prevalent at frequencies higher than 10% in Koreans, also are noted to be associated with viral clearance [53]–[55]. Our previous study also showed that there are distinct mutation patterns and a very high mutation frequency of the CD4+ T cell epitopes of the HBV preC/Core region in chronic Korean patients, strongly supporting the hypothesis of this study [56].Third, the frequency of dN within the CD8+ T cell epitope region of NS5B was significantly higher than that outside the CD8+ T cell epitope region [inside CD8+ (2.9%) vs. outside (2.3%), p = 0.001], suggesting the presence of immune pressure at the CD8+ T cell level against HCV NS5B among Korean patients, as shown in patients from other areas (Table 3) [37], [44], [47], [57]. However, pronounced differences in the mutation frequency between six regions of CD8+ T cell epitopes were found. Two of the six CD8+ T cell epitopes (308 to 315 aa and 451 to 459) with high binding affinity to two HLA allele types, HLA-A02:01 and HLA-A24:02, prevalent in Koreans, showed a higher dN frequency compared to other epitopes [308–315: 96 (7.2%) and 451–459: 49 (3.3%)], suggesting the presence of distinct MHC class I restricted immune pressure in Korean patients [52]. Particularly, it is noteworthy that the extraordinary high dN/dS ratio (2.04) found in a region of the CD8+ T cell epitope covering codons 308 to 315, was mainly due to the presence of frequent mutations in codon 309, one of four codons related to SVR rates (Table S4, Fig. 2). The mutation type, Q309R, is known to be frequently mutated in NS5B, particularly in Asian patients. However, even compared to Japanese patients, also an Asian country like Korea, the strikingly high mutation frequency of Q309R was observed in only the Korean patients [15], [16]. All of the 15 patients harbored this mutation in their quasispecies distribution and more than half (96/166, 57.8%) of all quasispecies from the 15 patients had the mutation type R309. Interestingly, the co-existence of both mutated and wild types, not exclusive of the existence of one type alone, was found in all 15 patients, suggesting the advantage of the coexistence of two variants in a patient over the exclusive existence of either type alone in an escape of host immune surveillance or viral fitness (Table S6). Therefore, the high frequency of the Q309R mutation in Korean patients may be induced by CD8+ T cell immune pressure which may in part provide a likely explanation for the high SVR rates in Koreans.Finally, it is well known that mutations in NS5B can affect the HCV replication capacity [19]. We found a total of three types of mutations (C316N, Q355K/R and E464Q) which had a significant effect on HCV replication (Cq value: C316N and E464Q p = 0.033, Q355K/R p = 0.003) (Table S3). Interestingly, our quasispecies analysis showed that two polymorphisms in aa 316, C316 and N316, were strongly related to two polymorphisms in codon 464, Q464 and E464, respectively, in an exclusive manner (Figure 1). The type with both C316 and Q464 signatures showed a significantly higher HCV replication capacity and was more related to patients with advanced liver disease compared to the type with both the N316 and E464 signatures. The exclusive combination of the SNPs of two codons may be due to the structural constraint of NS5B. Furthermore, the coexistence of both types (C316/Q464 and N316/E464) was not found in any patients, suggesting that these two types may be from completely different resources and not a different quasispecies version induced by immune pressure from a patient. Our data showing phylogenetic segregation between the two types also supports the above hypothesis.Our study has three potential limitations. First, the nested PCR protocol used in this study showed low sensitivity, with the amplification of only 23 samples out of 73 samples (31.5%). The strategies for the nested PCR protocol including primer sets and a PCR condition should be modified in the future study. Particularly, PCR negative amplifications were found with high frequencies in samples with lower HCV viral loads, suggesting novel nested PCR protocol to increase the degree of sensitivity should be applied in a future study. Second, the modest population size (15 patients) is relatively small to lead to a meaningful conclusion about the relationship between NS5B mutations and liver disease progression. Third, as single-genome amplification and an end-point dilution strategy were not utilized, the cloning strategy employed in this study is limited when used to represent genuine viral quasispecies in serum samples.In conclusion, our data suggest that the distinct MHC class II restricted immune pressure against HCV NS5B in Korean patients leads to a pronounced high mutation frequency and distinct mutation patterns in HCV NS5B in Korean patients. This finding provides important insight into the high SVR and ETR rates during the treatment of GT-1b infected Korean patients."
