"3.1 Characteristics of articles
Figure 1 shows the literature search and study selection procedures. A total of 471 potentially relevant publications up to 30 April, 2012, were initially identified through MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library, 443 of which were excluded because they did not meet our inclusion criteria. Therefore, 28 studies involving a total number of 10,024 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Study characteristics are shown in Table 1. There were 5616 males and 3974 females, and the sex was not reported in the remaining 434 patients (1 study). Nineteen studies (7542 patients) evaluated liver fibrosis according to rs12979860 polymorphism and 16 studies (5052 patients) according to rs8099917 polymorphism; four studies (2301 patients) evaluated inflammation activity according to rs12979860 polymorphism and eight studies (2904 patients) according to rs8099917 polymorphism; and four studies (962 patients) evaluated steatosis according to rs12979860 polymorphism and five studies (1308 patients) according to rs8099917 polymorphism.

3.2 Fibrosis
For rs12979860, the between-study heterogeneity was not significant (I2 = 25%, P = 0.147); thus, the fixed-effects model was applied. The pooled results indicated that IL28B rs12979860 genotype CC was associated with an increased possibility of severe fibrosis (OR, 1.122; 95%CI, 1.003–1.254; P = 0.044) (Fig. 2-a). For rs8099917, there was no or low heterogeneity (I2 = 31%, P = 0.111), and IL28B rs8099917 genotype TT tended to be associated with a higher possibility of severe fibrosis; however, the difference did not reach statistical significance (OR, 1.126; 95%CI, 0.988–1.284; P = 0.076) (Fig. 2-b). Egger's test showed no evidence for publication biases for either rs12979860 (P = 0.839) or rs8099917 (P = 0.342). When restricted to studies in which only treatment-naïve patients were included, 12 studies (5865 patients) according to rs12979860 polymorphism and eight studies (3333 patients) according to rs8099917 polymorphism were extracted. The between-study heterogeneities were not significant for rs12979860 (I2 = 0%, P = 0.615) and rs8099917 (I2 = 16%, P = 0.304). For rs12979860, fixed-effect model analyses showed a higher probability of severe fibrosis in genotype CC (OR, 1.184; 95%CI, 1.040–1.348; P = 0.010) (Fig. 2-c), and for rs8099917, genotype TT tended to be associated with a higher possibility of severe fibrosis; however, the difference was not statistically significant (OR, 1.154; 95%CI, 0.985–1.351; P = 0.076) (Fig. 2-d). Egger's test showed no evidence of publication bias (P = 0.394 for rs12979860 and P = 0.295 for rs8099917).

The between-study heterogeneity was not significant (I2 = 35%, P = 0.204) for rs12979860. In the fixed-effects model, the pooled results indicated that IL28B rs12979860 genotype CC was associated with a higher possibility of severe inflammation activity (OR, 1.288; 95%CI, 1.050–1.581; P = 0.015) (Fig. 3-a). For rs8099917, there was no or low heterogeneity (I2 = 0%, P = 0.598), and IL28B rs8099917 genotype TT was also associated with a higher possibility of severe inflammation activity (OR, 1.324; 95%CI, 1.110–1.579; P = 0.002) (Fig. 3-b). Egger's test showed no evidence of publication biases for rs12979860 (P = 0.448) and rs8099917 (P = 0.531). When restricted to studies in which only treatment-naïve patients were included, three studies (2192 patients) according to rs12979860 polymorphism and two studies (1769 patients) according to rs8099917 polymorphism were extracted. Significant heterogeneities were found for rs12979860 (I2 = 53%, P = 0.120); thus, the random-effect model was applied. The pooled results indicated that IL28B rs12979860 genotype was not associated with inflammatory activity (OR, 1.340; 95%CI, 0.938–1.916; P = 0.108) (Fig. 3-c). For rs8099917, the between-study heterogeneity was not significant (I2 = 0%, P = 0.585). In the fixed-effects model, genotype TT tended to be associated with a higher possibility of severe inflammation activity (OR, 1.217; 95%CI, 0.978–1.515; P = 0.079) (Fig. 3-d). Egger's test showed no evidence of publication bias in rs12979860 (P = 0.646). For rs8099917, Egger's test was not applicable because only 2 studies were included. We also performed a meta-regression analysis for rs12979860 because significant heterogeneities were observed. Table 2 shows the results of these meta-regression analyses. Significant correlation was observed between rs12979860 polymorphisms and the proportion of patients with genotype 1 or 4 virus (slope, 2.992±1.497; P = 0.046).

3.4 Steatosis
Significant heterogeneities were found for rs12979860 (I2 = 86%, P<0.001) and rs8099917 (I2 = 52%, P = 0.082); thus, we applied the random-effects model for this outcome. The pooled results indicated that IL28B rs12979860 genotype CC was not associated with hepatic steatosis (OR, 1.062; 95%CI, 0.415–2.717, P = 0.901) (Fig. 4-a), whereas rs8099917 TT was significantly associated with a lower possibility of severe steatosis (OR, 0.580; 95%CI, 0.351–0.959; P = 0.034) (Fig. 4-b). Egger's test showed no evidence of publication biases for rs12979860 (P = 0.238) or rs8099917 (P = 0.182). We also performed a meta-regression analysis because significant heterogeneities were observed. Table 3 shows the results of these meta-regression analyses. In terms of the effect of rs12979860 on steatosis, significant correlations were observed between the proportion of patients with genotype 1 or 4 virus (slope, −4.947±1.086; P<0.001), the proportion of Caucasian patients (slope, 7.361±1.569; P<0.001), and the proportion of African-American patients (slope, −8.996±1.918; P<0.001). We also observed a significant correlation between the effect of rs8099917 polymorphism on steatosis and the proportion of male patients (slope, 6.225±2.530; P = 0.014) (Fig. 5). Finally, we observed significant correlations between rs8099917 polymorphisms and the proportion of patients with genotype 1 or 4 virus (slope, −2.704±1.277; P = 0.034), the proportion of Caucasian patients (slope, 1.168±0.422; P = 0.006), and the proportion of Asian patients (slope, −1.049±0.398; P = 0.008). When restricted to studies in which only treatment-naïve patients were included, two studies (495 patients) according to rs12979860 polymorphism and four studies (812 patients) according to rs8099917 polymorphism were extracted. The between-study heterogeneities were not significant for rs12979860 (I2 = 0%, P = 0.823) and rs8099917 (I2 = 41%, P = 0.166). For rs12979860, fixed-effect model analyses showed that rs12979860 genotype CC was significantly associated with a higher possibility of severe steatosis (OR, 1.708; 95%CI, 1.047–2.787; P = 0.032) (Fig. 4-c), whereas rs8099917 TT was significantly associated with a lower possibility of severe steatosis (OR, 0.675; 95%CI, 0.474–0.960; P = 0.026) (Fig. 4-d). Egger's test showed no evidence of publication bias in rs8099917 (P = 0.554). For rs12979860, Egger's test was not applicable because only 2 studies were included.

The rs12979860 CC genotype was significantly associated with a higher probability of severe fibrosis (Fig. 2-c), and the rs8099917 TT genotype tended to be associated with a higher possibility of severe fibrosis (Fig. 2-d). The accumulation of liver inflammation promotes liver fibrosis, and these polymorphisms are associated with the effect of IFN-based treatment; therefore, past treatment might alter the results. Thus, we also analyzed studies involving only patients without a history of IFN-based treatment; however, the results were not changed.The rs12979860 CC and rs8099917 TT genotypes were also associated with a higher possibility of severe inflammation activity. Genetic variations near the IL28B gene were originally reported as strong predictors of a sustained viral response [17]–[20] or spontaneous clearance of HCV [21]. The level of IL28B gene transcripts is reportedly higher in patients homozygous for the IFN responsive allele [18], [19]. Therefore, in patients with the rs12979860 CC and rs8099917 TT genotype, IL28B production, which induces expression of interferon-stimulated genes, including some inflammatory cytokines, was thought to be increased. This may be the underlying cause of the higher inflammation activity and progressed fibrosis in patients with the IFN responsive allele. In analysis with the studies involving only patients without a history of IFN-based treatment, rs12979860 CC and rs8099917 TT genotypes were associated with higher possibility of having severe inflammation activity; however, the differences did not reach to the significant level. Only three studies according to rs12979860 polymorphism and two studies according to rs8099917 polymorphism were included when restricted to studies with only treatment-naïve patients, and may be underpowered to detect the effects of IL28B polymorphisms on inflammation activity. The further analyses with larger sample are needed to confirm this association. Additionally, meta-regression analysis showed that the effect of the rs12979860 polymorphism was influenced by viral genotype distribution. This result may imply a different influence of rs12979860 polymorphism on immune response according to viral genotype in treatment-naïve patients.IL28B polymorphisms were also shown to be associated with lipid metabolism [25]. In the present study, the rs8099917 TT genotype was significantly associated with a lower possibility of severe steatosis. This association still remained statistically significant after we restricted to studies in which only treatment-naïve patients were included. The lower hepatic steatosis in patients with the IFN responsive allele could be explained by a more efficient export of lipids from hepatocytes. Higher interferon expression was shown to lead to suppression of lipoprotein lipase, which would result in decreased conversion of VLDL to LDL and subsequent higher steatosis [30]–[33]. The difference in IL28B expression might cause an aberration of lipid metabolism in patients with CHC. We found no significant association of rs12979860 with steatosis. And when we restricted to treatment-naïve patients, rs12979860 CC genotype was significantly associated with a higher possibility of severe steatosis. Previous studies have shown that racial differences or viral genotypes make a difference in the effects of rs12979860 and rs8099917 polymorphisms [34], [35]. This may explain the discrepancy between the effect of rs12979860 and rs8099917 on hepatic steatosis. However, only four studies (962 patients) were included in the analysis of rs12979860; or when it comes to the studies with only treatment-naïve patients, only two studies (495 patients) were extracted. Thus, we should not make any definite conclusion on this matter right now. Further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to identify their exact correlation.According to the meta-regression analysis, the effect of rs8099917 polymorphisms on steatosis became smaller with the increase in the male proportion (Fig. 5), suggesting that a sexual dimorphism might be involved in the effect of rs8099917 polymorphisms on the liver fat content. Although the present study cannot explain the interaction between the polymorphism and sex, immune systems responding to IFN are reportedly controlled by estrogenic sex hormones [36], [37]. Differences in IL28B expression mediated by sex hormones could be a possible mechanism for the sexual dimorphism in the effect of rs8099917 polymorphisms on liver steatosis.The rs738409 genotype within the patatin-like phospholipase domain containing 3 locus was also reported to be associated with hepatic steatosis in patients with CHC [38]–[40]. Notably, previous meta-analysis evaluating the effect of patatin-like phospholipase domain containing 3 polymorphisms on steatosis also reported a negative correlation between the male proportion and the effect of rs738409 on the liver fat content in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [41]. Interestingly, the meta-regression analysis in the present study showed that the effect of the IL28B (rs12979860 and rs8099917) polymorphisms on steatosis was also influenced by racial and viral genotype distributions.In the present study, we included studies that did not report the associations between IL28B genotypes and background liver diseases as study outcomes, but provided raw data that allowed us to calculate the OR for each outcome, which may have minimized potential publication bias. In fact, no publication bias was observed in the present study. The Human Genome Epidemiology Network highlighted the necessity of meta-analysis before evidence for a particular association can be regarded as strong [42]. The impact of IL28B genotypes on the disease progression found in the present meta-analysis may provide clinically important information in the follow-up of patients with CHC. The effect of IL28B polymorphisms on hepatocarcinogenesis, which is also crucial information in the HCC screening of patients with CHC, remains controversial [43]–[47]. Further analysis with larger sample sizes may be needed to elucidate the exact effect of IL28B polymorphisms on hepatocarcinogenesis.A potential limitation of this study is inter-study variability in the outcome measure and the definition of “severe” among studies, where some discrepancies among studies exist. The studies without a pathological diagnosis, using laboratory data as surrogates, were also included. These studies may have diminished the accuracy of our research results concerning liver disease severity.In conclusion, the present study highlighted the impact of IL28B polymorphisms on liver fibrosis, inflammation activity, and steatosis in patients with CHC. Disease progression appeared to be promoted in patients with rs12979860 CC or rs8099917 TT genotypes. The current findings may provide clinically important information in the follow-up of patients with CHC."
