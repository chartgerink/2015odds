"Patient population
In total, 1006 patients were included in a nationwide registry for patients with hepatitis C genotype 2 or 3 [15]. Out of these, 226 tested HCV RNA-positive at week 4 (non-RVR). In total, 104 out of the 1006 (10%) patients from the nationwide registry could be screened between week 12 and 22 of standard therapy for this study. Ninety-nine (9.8%) patients fulfilled in- and exclusion criteria, of which 83 patients had genotype 3 (n = 67 genotype 3a, n = 16 subtype n.a.) and 16 patients had genotype 2 (n = 4 genotype 2a, n = 6 genotype 2b, n = 6 n.a.). 50 patients were randomized into Group A and 49 patients into Group B. Patients were randomized during the screening phase (standard treatment week 12–22) and 5 patients dropped out before start of the study (week 24 of ongoing treatment) but after randomization (three patients in Group A and two in Group B). For further analysis all randomized patients were included. The mean age of patients at baseline was 45.0 ± 8.9 years with the majority of patients being male. We observed no statistical significant differences in baseline characteristics between both groups with exception in bilirubin. Patients in Group A had significantly higher bilirubin levels compared to Group B (0.65 ± 0.33 vs. 0.51 ± 0.23; p = 0.016). However, in only few of the patients bilirubin levels were above the upper limit of normal (Table 2). The patient flow is visualized in Figs 2 and 3. 10.1371/journal.pone.0128069.t002

Fig 3 Flow chart of patients recruited for the OPTEX trial. Adverse events
All patients in Group A and B, respectively, received at least one dose of study medication. In total, 74 (75%) individuals completed the study according to the study protocol (39 (78%) individuals in Group A and 35 (71%) in Group B, respectively). One patient in Group A died during the study due to hepatocellular carcinoma. In addition, six patients withdrew informed consent (three in each group) without mentioning the reason, nine patients were lost to follow-up (three in Group A and six in Group B), four patients stopped the study prematurely due to therapy failure (one in Group A and three in Group B) and five patients did not finish the study according protocol due to other reasons.
Overall, 302 adverse events were observed with 191 events in Group A and 111 in Group B. At least one adverse event was observed in 80 out of 99 (89%) randomized patients and in 79 out of 94 (84%) patients who received at least one dose of medication. In Group A 42 and in Group B 38 patients suffered from at least one adverse event. The adverse events were those typically associated with PEG-IFN or ribavirin treatment, and no unexpected adverse events occurred. At EOT skin and subcutaneous disorders were the group of adverse events with the highest frequency in both groups with 56% in Group A and 41% in Group B (p = 0.13) followed by psychiatric disorders in 48% and 25%, respectively (p = 0.02). The third common adverse events were general disorders and administration site conditions with 42% in Group A and 29% in Group B (p = 0.16). The nine serious adverse events that occurred in the study are described in detail in table 3. Dose modifications were done only in the minority of patients without being statistical significant between both treatment groups. In Group A and B the dose of PEG-IFN was increased in one and two patients, respectively. Dose reduction was necessary in four patients in Group A and in three patients in Group B. The dose of RBV was increased in one patient out of Group B and decreased in two patients in each treatment group. 10.1371/journal.pone.0128069.t003

The primary end point, reduction of relapse rate (HCV-RNA positive in serum by a standard HCV-PCR with a detection limit of at least 15 IU/ml) 24 weeks after the end of treatment and thus improvement of sustained virological response rates (SVR) in patients without RVR and 48 weeks of therapy (Group A) was achieved by 34 out of 50 (68%) patients which is similar to the historical control group with SVR of 70% (p = 0.6191). Therefore, the primary aim of this study was not achieved.
No statistical significant differences regarding virological response rates were observed between Group A and Group B (Fig 4). in the ITT analysis as well as in the analysis of the completer only (Table 4, Subgroups in Table 5). In Group B no significant differences to the control group were observed at FU24. The breakthrough and relapse rates were comparable in both treatment groups in all populations (completer breakthrough: 3% vs. 0%; p = 1.0 and relapse: 13% vs. 18%; p = 0.86) (Fig 5). Breakthrough was defined as reappearance of HCV RNA during therapy. 10.1371/journal.pone.0128069.g004

0.0619 A secondary endpoint was biochemical response at end of treatment and 24 weeks after therapy cessation. Response was defined as ALT and/ or AST normalization (≤ 1.5x upper limit of normal) at that specific time point. Overall, the majority of patients achieved a biochemical response within the ITT and in the group of completer. In all specific patient populations we observed no statistical significant differences between Group A and B at FU24. In Group A 92% of completer achieved normalization of ALT and 88% in Group B
Analysis of the quality of life was assessed with the SF-36 questionnaire at baseline, treatment week 12 and 24 (Group A only) as well as at follow-up 12 and 24. At all time points we observed no statistical significant differences between Group A and B. As expected under therapy with PEG-IFN and ribavirin in both groups the mean physical as well as mental health score was lower during therapy compared to the phase of follow-up. However, in both groups the patients indicated their quality of life inferior to the reference population with a mean of 50 even in the phase of follow-up. During the first 12 weeks of follow-up the quality of life improved in both groups. Importantly, during week 12 and 24 of follow-up no further improvement was observed (Fig 6 and Table 7). 10.1371/journal.pone.0128069.g006

50.7917.40–57.819.0724 The prospective OPTEX trial investigated the efficacy of treatment prolongation to 36–48 weeks with pegylated interferon alpha-2b and ribavirin in patients with genotype 2/3 and non-RVR showed no major improvement of SVR compared to historical data with 24 weeks treatment. However, our study has some limitations. One of these limitations is that the anticipated number of patients for the study was not reached. Initially, the study was powered for 150 patients in total with 75 in each Group. All patients with non-RVR within a nationwide non-interventional registry should be screened for the OPTEX trial. Initially it was planned to enrol 700 patients between June 2008 and December 2010 in the German G2/3 registry. However, despite an extension of the enrolment in the registry of two years and enrolment of more than 1000 patients in the registry, the calculated number of patients was not achieved. Based on these results roughly 1500 patients had to be enrolled in the registry in order to achieve the enrolment of 150 patients with non-RVR for this trial. Major reasons for the low number of screened patients were the high rate of patients who had not been treated for 24 weeks, the high number of patients without week 4 response data and the low frequency of non-RVR in HCV genotype 2 and 3 patients (Fig 3). This limitation can be seen as an important results indicating that dual therapy of PEG-IFN/RBV is highly effective in the majority of G2/3 patients [15]. Another limitation is, that IL28B (IFNL3) testing was not part of the study protocol as the study was initiated before the discovery that IL28B is predictive for IFN response in chronic hepatitis C [21]. However, we could retrospectively test IL28B in about 2/3 of the patients. The SVR rate was not lower in the patients with the unfavourable IL28B-rs8099960-*T genotypes. The number of patients is too low to draw any conclusion on IL28B genotypes but we think that in patients with non-RVR we have already pre-selected the difficult to treat patients. Thus, the IL28B genotype may not have this great impact as in other cohorts.Overall only 119 patients were eligible for the screening but again not all (n = 104) individuals were screened mainly due to the fear of further side effects for additional 12 or 24 weeks caused by study medication. This, on the other side, emphasizes the need for less toxic IFN free therapies. The analysis of the SF-36 questionnaire clearly showed the impaired quality of life in all patients within this study. Indeed, many physicians decided to wait for sofosbuvir regimens in G2/3 patients. During the study period, new data for sofosbuvir have been released and showed promising results in several clinical trials in all HCV genotypes even in genotype 3 [7]. Treatment of chronic hepatitis C has dramatically changed with the development of DAA. For genotype 2/3 the NS5B polymerase inhibitor sofobuvir is now approved and effective. However, many countries around the world have limited access to sofosbuvir in 2014. Also for countries with access to DAA, the treatment for 12–24 weeks is expensive with 60,000 to 120,000 € per treatment. The old standard treatment PEG-IFN/RBV can also be highly effective in patients with Genotypes 2/3, especially in patients with rapid virological response [15]. On the other hand, patients without RVR showed lower SVR rates after 24 weeks of treatment and treatment prolongation as shown here does not substantially increase the success rate. Only patients that are fully adherent and complete 48-week treatment with PEG-IFN/RBV may benefit from this prolonged treatment approach. Interestingly, females treated for 48 weeks were the only subgroup that reached nearly 90% SVR in the ITT analysis, which is nowadays the SVR rate to aim for (Table 5). However, the tolerability is difficult to predict early during treatment and based on the current development in the HCV field, we would like to propose a response guided treatment algorithm for non-cirrhotic naïve G2/3 patients without contraindications for PEG-IFN. This approach includes treatment with PEG-IFN/RBV of easy to treat G2/3 patients and adding or switch to sofosbuvir in the non-RVR patients. IL28B genotyping may be helpful in selecting patients which are more likely to achieve RVR and thus being the adequate patient for this approach [22,23]. If dual therapy is initiated, this therapy should be stopped if HCV RNA is positive after 4 weeks (independent of IL28B genotype) because even longer treatment does not increase overall SVR sufficiently. In that case, sofosbuvir based DAA treatment should be started. This response-guided approach may be especially important for patients with genotype 3 because the DAAs are least effective for genotype 3 and our study enrolled mainly patients with genotype 3.In conclusion, approximately ¼ of G2/3 patients treated with dual PEG-IFN/RBV did not achieve RVR in a real world setting. Treatment duration longer than 24 weeks did not result in higher SVR compared to a historical control group and should therefore not be considered in the era of DAA."
