Input factors and Outcome We used the clinical data to determine input factors X1–X21, which were used to predict the outcomes of individual patients using MLR and ANN analysis (table 2). X1–X4 represented the patient's sex, age, height, and weight, respectively. X5 and X6 represented previous treatment with interferon and interferon plus RBV, respectively. X7 and X8 represented the initial doses of PEGIFN and RBV, respectively. X9–X16 represented laboratory variables (X9, white blood cell count; X10, red blood cell count; X11, haemoglobin level; X12, platelet count; X13, serum AST level; X14, serum ALT level; X15, serum creatinine level; and X16, serum total cholesterol level). X17 represented the presence of diabetes mellitus, X18 represented the HCV RNA level, X19 and X20 represented the total amount of administered PEGIFN and RBV, respectively, and X21 represented EVR, defined as the a 2-log decrease in the serum HCV RNA 12 weeks after therapy began. The outcome was SVR, which was determined 24 weeks after cessation of therapy. 10.1371/journal.pone.0027223.t002Table 2 Factors and outcomes used to predict individual patient outcomes.

Factor X20 (total amount of RBV administrated) was the next most effective factor (p<0.05). Factors X1 (sex), X9 (serum creatinine level), X15 (ALT level), and X16 (presence of diabetes mellitus) were the next most effective factors, but their regression coefficients were not statistically significant. Other factors had little effect on the response to therapy. 10.1371/journal.pone.0027223.t003Table 3 Results of multiple logistic regression analysis.

We randomly divided the whole data into training data set for generation of the predictive expressions and validation data set to evaluate their accuracy (table 4). As shown in table 4, there were no significant difference in all factors between training data set and validation data set. The sensitivities were 0.45 in MLR and 0.82 in ANN (table 5). The specificities were 0.55 in MLR and 0.88 in ANN. The low frequency of both sensitivity and specificity in MLR and improved in ANN suggest that a non-linear relationship exists between inputs and outcomes. We also conducted ROC curve analysis to evaluate the accuracy of each prediction. To validate propriety, we analysed the ROC using validation data without training data. The area under the curves of the ROCs (AUROCs) of MLR was 0.662 and the mean AUROCs for ANNs was 0.884 (figure 1). 10.1371/journal.pone.0027223.g001 Figure 1 ROCs for multiple logistic regression models and ANN: (A) MLRs, (B) ANNs. 10.1371/journal.pone.0027223.t004Table 4 Characteristics of patients in training and validation data set.

MLR ANN Sensitivity 0.45 0.82 Specificity 0.55 0.88 To evaluate the superiority in prediction of ANN, we randomly divided the all data into training data and validation data for 4 more times and evaluated the accuracy with same way. In all trials, the correct answer rate and AUROCs for the ANNs were significantly greater than that for MLRs (p<0.05) (table 6, 7 and figure 2, 3). 10.1371/journal.pone.0027223.g002 Figure 2 ROCs for four multiple logistic regression models: (A) trial 1, (B) trial 2, (C) trial 3, and (D) trial 4. 10.1371/journal.pone.0027223.g003 Figure 3 ROCs for several expressions of ANNs: (A) ANN1, (B) ANN2, (C) ANN3, and (D) ANN4.

Relative weights of the input factors determine how the result changes when the test factor (Xtest) is excluded. An Xtest value greater than 1 indicates that it improves the expression, and a value less than 1 indicates that it does not improve the expression. We analysed the value of all networks and determined the corresponding means and standard deviations. X21: EVR was the most important predictive factor in every trial. The means of X1: gender and X2: age, X3: height, X5: previous therapy with interferon, X8: initial dose of Ribavirin, X9: serum creatinine, X15: ALT, X16: Diabetes mellitus, X18: HCV RNA level before treatment were also more than 1, which indicates that they have non-linear relationships with response to therapy. 10.1371/journal.pone.0027223.g004 Figure 4 Non-linear analysis of factors for ANNs. Data are expressed as the mean±SD for member networks. Impact of post-treatment factors in prediction of treatment We also tried to predict the effect only using pre-treatment parameters (without using post-treatment parameters: X19: Total amount of PEGIFN administered, X20: Total amount of RBV administered, and X21: EVR), though the sensitivity and specificity were low (MLR; sensitivity 0.45, specificity 0.49, ANN; sensitivity 0.59, specificity 0.71) (table 8). 10.1371/journal.pone.0027223.t008Table 8 The sensitivity and specificity provided by multiple logistic regression analysis and ANN without post-treatment parameters. MLR ANN Sensitivity 0.45 0.59 Specificity 0.49 0.71 Interactions between clinical, genetic, and environmental factors may affect the efficacy of PEGIFN plus RBV combination therapy in CHC patients and should be taken into account by physicians when interpreting indications for therapy. Although there are reports on predictors of the response to treatment against the HCV [28], [29], data derived from clinical epidemiology studies and medical statistics do not always result in correct predictions at the level of the individual patient. For instance, both male sex and low total cholesterol level are considered indicative of a good prognosis [28], but the prognosis for a male who also has a high total cholesterol level is unknown. In contrast, ANNs can identify relationships within a patient's clinical data that may be overlooked when classical linear approaches are used [16]. MLRs are powerful tool to find significant factors and provide the key factors in present our study, though it is not suit to predict the results by using factors non-linearly correlate. Because ANNs are trained using existing data, they are more capable of providing correct answers for individual patients. The ANN also has theoretical advantages over conventional MLRs. Unlike MLRs, ANN can predict both linear and non-linear phenomena and can analyse relationships between many variables at different levels [25].The incidence of correct answers and the AUC of the MLRs differed greatly from that of the ANN. Moreover, it can say that data used in most previous studies were not validated because input data sets were used to estimate ROCs. Therefore, we used validation data sets to estimate ROCs. If we had used only input data in the ANN, the AUROC would have been equal to 100% because an ANN can fit input data perfectly. Compared with MLRs, a well-trained ANN can predict both linear and non-linear data.We note that, although the ANN is a useful model, the network logic of prediction cannot be broken down into simple elements because ANNs process data in a non-linear way [16], [18], [25], [30]–[32]. We analysed the relative weights of input factors to address this issue. The values of each factor affecting the outcome was analysed (figure 2). EVR was identified as the most important factor. Serum creatinine, initial dose of Ribavirin, gender and age also had high values (figure 2).Both physicians and patients express concern about the risks associated with treatment because the outcome is difficult to predict at the time decisions are made. The increased demand for individualised treatment necessitates new statistics that can be applied in conjunction with ethical and clinical evidence at the individual level. ANNs also have potential economic benefits in that they reduce unnecessary medical treatment.A report on the classification of patients was published recently [33]. Although this is a valid strategy, it is difficult to apply under clinical conditions because the ISDR mutant and Th1∶Th2 ratio must first be determined. Moreover, there are some conflicting reports on the ISDR mutant [34]. As the aforementioned report did not performed validation, they should not be compared with our results; however, the predictive accuracy of our technique is superior to them.The predictive expression developed in this study should aid physicians to advise individual patients on whether to continue with PEGIFN plus RBV combination therapy. We also tried to predict the effect only using pre-treatment parameters (table 8). Compare to the table 5, both sensitivity and specificity were dramatically improved by adding post-treatment parameter. Suggesting, post-treatment parameter such as adherence to treatment might affect to the effect of PEGIFN plus RBV combination therapy. As the EVR and total amount of RBV were the most important parameters in our study, the predictive expression could also be used to determine whether to increase the dose of RBV. Because we included the total amount of PEGIFN and RBV in the data sets, the effect of an increased dose can be simulated. Although the magnitude of the dose effect depends on patient's symptoms and exposure to adverse events, our technique remains a powerful tool for determining the appropriate dose of PEGIFN and RBV.Although our predictive expression does not predict responses perfectly, our results show that the ANN is a valid method for devising individual treatment regimens in the clinical situation. It is well known that 100% prediction accuracy is impossible to achieve because of random error and multiple biases.As the outcome of PEGIFN plus RBV treatment may be affected by multiple unknown factors, it is important to update data continuously and to acquire clinical data such as the patient's demographics, medical history, and laboratory test results. Recent accumulating data revealed the importance of IL28B gene from genome wide study [35]–[37]. Especially, very recent data clearly showed the significance of SNP rs12979860 in IL28B gene in the prediction of the treatment outcome [38]–[41]. We could not assess the effect of them in this study since we have not collected those data. Further analyses were needed though it may be improve the accuracy. It is also important to demonstrate that the use of trained ANNs in routine medical practice increases the quality of medical care and reduces costs."
