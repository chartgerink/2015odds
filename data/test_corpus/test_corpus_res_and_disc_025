"Virological Response to Treatment in the HALT-C Trial Demographic and clinical data at entry into HALT-C for all lead-in subjects who had an IL28B genotype result are shown in Table 1. Median age was 49 years, 72.4% were male, median pre-treatment HCV RNA was 6.5 log10 IU/ml; 37.6% had cirrhosis. Consistent with previous studies [5], [9], there was evidence for selection against the IL28B rs12979860-CC genotype among these patients, who had failed both to clear HCV spontaneously and to achieve SVR in response to prior therapy. IL28B rs12979860-CC frequency was 25.7% among 732 European American subjects in the Trial compared to 45.6% in the reference population (p<.0001) and 10.8% in 148 African American Trial subjects compared to 20.0% in the reference population (p = 0.01). 10.1371/journal.pone.0020904.t001Table 1 Demographic and clinical characteristics of subjects in the HALT-C Trial study of IL28B genotype.

Among European American patients who were infected with HCV genotype 1 (n = 646), the overall SVR rate was 14.2%. To examine the relationship between IL28B genotype and a range of virological responses, we performed an analysis among the 622 (96.3%) HCV genotype 1-infected European American patients who could be fully classified for virological response. IL28B rs12979860-CC frequency varied markedly by the degree of virological response (Figure 1; Table S3): null responders (referent), 6.9%; partial EVR, 24.4% (unadjusted OR,6.69; <.0001); breakthrough/relapse, 48.2%; SVR, 48.9%. The unadjusted OR observed for those with breakthrough/relapse and SVR were approximately 20 (p <.0001, each comparison), but the frequency of rs12979860-CC did not differ between these two groups even when other variables were considered in multivariate models (p = 0.56). Comparing subjects with undetectable HCV RNA at week 20 (breakthrough/relapse or SVR) to those with detectable virus (null or partial EVR) yielded adjusted ORs of 16.29 for rs12979860-CC (95% CI, 8.44–31.47; p<.0001) and 2.02 for rs12979860-CT (95% CI, 1.16–3.52; p = 0.01). 10.1371/journal.pone.0020904.g001 Figure 1 Distribution of IL28B rs12979860 genotypes, by response to treatment with pegylated-interferon-α2a plus ribavirin among European American subjects infected with HCV genotype 1, lead-in phase of the HALT-C Trial. EVR, early virological response; BT, breakthrough; SVR, sustained virological response. Among all European American subjects infected with HCV genotype 1, we compared IL28B genotype between those who achieved SVR and those who did not. Compared to rs12979860-TT, the OR for rs12979860-CC was 5.29 (95% CI, 2.46–11.38; p<.0001) and that for rs12979860-CT was 1.48 (95% CI, 0.69–3.16; p = 0.3). Fibrosis stage did not vary by rs12979860 genotype (mean and median = 4.0 for all three genotypes) in these subjects, but, consistent with prior reports [5], higher median pre-treatment HCV RNA levels were found in subjects with genotype rs12979860-CC (6.74 log10 IU/mL; p<.0001) and rs12979860–CT (6.50 log10 IU/mL; p = 0.04) compared to rs12979860-TT (6.41 log10 IU/mL). The logistic regression model included five variables: IL28B genotype (three categories), pre-treatment HCV RNA level (seven ordinal categories), AST/ALT ratio (five ordinal categories), Ishak fibrosis score (five ordinal categories) and prior treatment with ribavirin (yes/no). This model yielded an adjusted OR of 7.56 (95% CI, 3.20–17.87; p<.0001) for rs12979860-CC and an adjusted OR of 1.83 (95% CI, 0.82–4.11; p = 0.14) for rs12979860–CT. The final model is described by this equation: log odds = −2.8540−0.3532×fibrosis−0.4067×HCV RNA−0.4268×AST:ALT−0.6844×prior ribavirin+2.0226×IL28B rs12979860(CC)+0.6063×IL28B rs12979860(CT). Reference categories for co-variates are: HCV RNA = 6.50–6.74; AST∶ALT = 0.50–0.74, fibrosis = 3; prior ribavirin = yes; IL28B rs12979860(TT). On the basis of these log odds ratio parameter estimates, IL28B genotype was the strongest predictor of SVR in this study. Of the 646 European American subjects infected with HCV genotype 1, 350 were maintained on at least 80% of full dose for both pegylated-interferon-α2a and ribavirin for the first 20 weeks of treatment. Among this ‘fully adherent’ subgroup, the association between IL28B genotype and SVR (rs12979860-CC: adjusted OR, 7.91; 95% CI, 2.80–22.35; p<.0001. rs12979860–CT: adjusted OR, 1.75; 95% CI, 0.67–4.57; p = 0.25) was similar to that found among HCV genotype 1-infected European American subjects as a whole. Among 134 HCV genotype 1-infected African American patients, eight achieved SVR. For rs12979860-CC, the unadjusted OR was 12.69 (95% CI, 1.19–135.66; p = 0.04) and adjustment for covariates increased the association (adjusted OR, 48.02; 95% CI, 2.57–898.09; p = 0.01). The rs12979860-CC genotype was much more common in African American subjects with undetectable HCV RNA at week 20 (n = 21) than those with detectable virus (adjusted OR, 15.88; 95% CI, 2.90–86.96; p = 0.001). Hispanic subjects who were infected with HCV genotype 1 were too few (n = 67) for a meaningful analysis of virological response. IL28B rs8099917 has been associated with response to treatment for chronic hepatitis C [5], [6], [7], [8] and this SNP is in strong linkage disequilibrium with rs12979860 [5]. Associations of rs8099917 genotype with virological response were similar to those for rs12979860, but models including both SNPs showed no independent effect of rs8099917 (data not presented). Prediction of Treatment Response in the HALT-C Trial The subjects for the prediction model, European American patients who were infected with HCV genotype 1, were similar to HALT-C Trial lead-in subjects as a whole with regard to other demographic and clinical variables (Table 1). The distribution of IL28B rs12979860 genotypes among these 646 subjects was: CC, 24.0%; CT, 56.8%; TT, 19.2%. The logistic regression model based on IL28B genotype plus four clinical predictors of SVR (described above) fit the data better than models that included the four clinical predictors only or IL28B genotype only (p<0.001, both comparisons). For the full model (IL28B genotype plus clinical predictors), AUC was 78.5% compared to 73.0% for the model based on the clinical predictors without IL28B genotype (p<0.001; Figure 2). AUC was 60.0% for the model with IL28B genotype only. 10.1371/journal.pone.0020904.g002 Figure 2 Area under the ‘receiver operating characteristic’ curve (AUC) for models predicting the probability of sustained virological response (SVR) - European American patients infected with HCV genotype 1, HALT-C Trial. Full model: IL28B rs12979860 genotype plus four clinical variables. AUC was calculated using predicted probabilities of SVR based on a series of leave-one-out cross-validation logistic regression models. Based on the LOOCV models, 30.2% of these HALT-C subjects had an a priori predicted probability of achieving SVR <5%, 56.7% had a predicted probability <10%, 77.6% had a predicted probability <20% and 90.1% had a predicted probability <35% (Table 2). The distributions of a priori predicted probabilities of SVR differed markedly between the 554 non-responders and the 92 subjects who actually achieved SVR (Figure 3). For example, 36.5% of non-responders had a predicted probability ≥10%, compared to 84.8% of HALT-C subjects who achieved SVR. As a result of this relationship, the IL28B genotype-based model could predict which HALT-C subjects were more likely to achieve SVR. Table 2 shows SVR rates under a range of model-based treatment decision scenarios. For example, among the 280 HALT-C subjects with a predicted probability ≥10%, the observed SVR rate was 27.9%, compared to an SVR rate of 3.8% among the 366 patients with a predicted probability <10%. For HALT-C subjects, a strategy of treating those with a predicted probability ≥10% (and deferring treatment for the remaining subjects) would have yielded ∼85% of the total number of patients with SVR through treatment of 43% of the patients. Limiting treatment to those with a predicted probability ≥15%, would increase the SVR rate to 32.5% and decrease the number treated to 194 (30.0% of total subjects), while also decreasing the number who achieved SVR to 63 (68.5% of all subjects who actually achieved SVR). 10.1371/journal.pone.0020904.g003 Figure 3 Distributions of a priori predicted probability of sustained virological response (SVR) for 554 non-responders and 92 subjects who achieved SVR - European American patients infected with HCV genotype 1, HALT-C Trial.

Clinical profile 1consists of relatively favorable values for the four clinical predictors (HCV RNA, 5.75–5.99; AST/ALT, 0.50–0.74; no prior ribavirin; fibrosis score, 3). Among individuals with this clinical profile, the model predicted a probability of SVR as 74.5% for patients with the IL28B-CC genotype, 41.5% for IL28B-CT and 27.9% for IL28B-TT. Among individuals with the ‘intermediate’ clinical profile (Clinical profile 2: HCV RNA, 6.25–6.49; AST/ALT, 0.75–0.99; no prior ribavirin, fibrosis score, 4), the range in genotype-specific predicted probability of SVR was 30.0% (IL28B-CC, 37.3%; IL28B-CT, 12.6%; IL28B-TT, 7.3%). With a very unfavorable non-genetic profile (Clinical profile 3: HCV RNA, 6.75–6.99; AST/ALT, 1.00–1.24; prior ribavirin, fibrosis score, 5), the model predicted a very low SVR probability for all genotypes including IL28B-CC (5.7%). 10.1371/journal.pone.0020904.g004 Figure 4 Observed and predicted probabilities of sustained virological response (SVR), by IL28B rs12979860 genotype, among European American patients infected with HCV genotype 1, HALT-C Trial. ‘Overall’ probabilities were directly observed. Probabilities for the selected clinical profiles were predicted from the model. Prediction of Treatment Response in the IDEAL Study To determine whether both IL28B genotype and clinical variables improve clinical prediction in a treatment naïve population, we used published data [22] among 1,121 HCV genotype 1-infected European American patients enrolled in the IDEAL study. The overall SVR rate in this population was 45.3%. AUC values were: IL28B genotype, HCV RNA and fibrosis, 73.7%; IL28B genotype, 67.8%; HCV RNA and fibrosis, 60.0% (all AUC values differ from each other, p<.01). We demonstrated that IL28B genotype is a very strong predictor of SVR among patients with advanced chronic hepatitis C who failed previous therapy and then used these data to create a model to predict the probability of SVR based on IL28B genotype and selected clinical factors. The model must be validated in other populations before it can be implemented clinically, but our results provide ‘proof of concept’ that this approach has the potential to improve the care of patients with chronic hepatitis C. Patients with advanced chronic hepatitis C who have failed to respond to prior treatment for chronic hepatitis C have a very low rate of SVR overall, nonetheless the model identified patient profiles associated with a high probability of treatment response. As expected, most HALT-C subjects had a profile associated with a very low a priori probability of achieving SVR. Treatment decisions involve many considerations, but our work suggests that identifying patients with a low likelihood of success and advising them to await availability of more effective regimens could reduce the number of patients who would be exposed to a treatment with substantial adverse effects from which they will not derive a benefit, while having much less impact on the number who respond. For example, if treatment of HALT-C subjects had been limited to patients with a predicted probability ≥10%, 57% would have been spared treatment, the SVR rate would have been double and the number of subjects achieving SVR would have been 85% of that attained through treating the entire group.Although IL28B genotype was the strongest predictor of SVR in this study, the prediction model was greatly improved by the inclusion of four parameters commonly available in clinical practice (pre-treatment HCV RNA level; AST/ALT ratio; fibrosis score; whether or not the patient received ribavirin during previous interferon-based treatment). In building the model, we divided continuous variables into multiple categories to avoid assumptions about the relationship between a variable and SVR based solely on the associations observed among HALT-C subjects. In addition, although the difference in SVR rate between rs12979860-CT and rs12979860-TT (adjusted OR, 1.83) did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.14), we retained all three IL28B genotype categories, which is consistent with the approach of some other groups [7]. The number of variables and categories in the model should not present a barrier to its clinical implementation, as these could be accommodated easily in a computer-based instrument.Some variables previously associated with SVR were not selected into our logistic regression model. The effect of these variables may have been accounted for by variables in the model or our statistical power may have been inadequate to select these variables. Additional subjects might allow us to add variables to the model and improve its predictive ability.Published data on joint SVR rates by IL28B genotype, HCV RNA level and fibrosis score (from the IDEAL study), allowed us to verify that AUC is increased among treatment naïve patients when both IL28B genotype and clinical variables are considered. However, individual patient data are required for our model and with additional data, our modeling approach could be extended. The HALT-C Trial was limited to subjects with advanced chronic hepatitis C who had failed to respond to previous interferon-based treatment. In developing the model, we further restricted subjects to those who were infected with HCV genotype 1 and of European ancestry because there were too few subjects in other ‘race’ or viral genotype groups for meaningful analysis. Given sufficient data, a prediction model for chronic hepatitis C treatment response could encompass the full range of HCV-infected patients, including those previously naïve for peg-interferon- alfa/ribavirin and those receiving regimens that include additional agents. Our modeling approach also could be expanded to include data on rapid virological response, but, unfortunately, those data are incomplete among HALT-C subjects. A ‘non-invasive’ prediction model that would not require measurement of fibrosis by liver biopsy might be desirable, but development and evaluation of such a model requires subjects encompassing the full range of fibrosis values.Direct acting anti-viral agents that inhibit HCV replication, currently in late clinical development, promise to improve the SVR rate for patients who have failed to respond to treatment with interferon- alfa and ribavirin [23], as well as for patients who have not been treated for chronic hepatitis C previously [24], [25]. These compounds, which select drug-resistant HCV strains if used alone [26], will likely be combined with peginterferon alfa/ribavirin to reduce viral replication and mutational escape. Among patients who were treated with a regimen of peginterferon alfa/ribavirin plus the HCV-protease inhibitor telaprevir, 84% of those with the IL28B rs12979860-CC genotype achieved SVR compared to 32% among those with either IL28B rs12979860-CT or –TT [27]. Indirect evidence also suggests that IL28B genotype may be associated with response to a peginterferon alfa/ribavirin/telaprevir regimen. A recent trial among HCV-infected patients who had failed initial peginterferon alfa/ribavirin treatment found that retreatment with a regimen that included telaprevir was more effective among patients who had relapsed during previous treatment compared to previous nonresponders [23]. Given the strong association we observed between IL28B genotype and breakthrough/relapse, it is quite plausible that IL28B genotype is associated with response to a peginterferon alfa/ribavirin/telaprevir regimen. Therefore, an IL28B genotype-based model may identify patients who are at high risk for treatment failure (and selection of resistant HCV strains) when treated with this regimen.Our work demonstrates that a model based on IL28B genotype and a few clinical variables can provide individualized predictions for the probability of achieving SVR after treatment with peg-interferon- alfa/ribavirin. If the IL28B genotype-based model is validated in a wide range of patients with chronic HCV infection, then development of a computer based algorithm for clinical decision making would seem warranted. Such a tool could improve patient outcomes among patients treated for chronic hepatitis C by increasing SVR rates and reducing the frequency of futile treatment, with its substantial costs and adverse effects."
