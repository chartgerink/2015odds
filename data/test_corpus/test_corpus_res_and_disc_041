"The distribution of IFNL3 genotypes was: 8 CC (25%), 13 CT (40.5%), 11 TT (34.5%); the distribution of IFNL4 genotypes was: 18 TT/TT (56.2%), 10 TT/ΔG (31.3%), 4 ΔG/ΔG (12.5%) (Table 1). As shown in Fig. 1, median levels of IFNAR-1 mRNA in PBMC from patients carrying IFNL4 TT/TT were 1,82 fold higher than those from patients carrying the ΔG allele (either TT/ΔG or ΔG/ΔG) [median: 1.026 (IQR: 0.5710–1.420) vs 0.5640 (0.4585–0.9135) p = 0.0053]. No correlation between IFNAR-1 expression and HCV viral load was observed (r = -0.1152; p = 0.6598).

Fig 1 Levels of IFNAR-1 mRNA in PBMC from HCV-infected naїve subjects carrying IFNL4 ss469415590 TT/TT genotype vs patients carrying the ΔG allele.
Results are expressed as ratio to beta-actin. The horizontal bar indicates median. When considering the patients grouped according to the IFNL3 and IFNL4 genotype combinations, 8 patients were IFNL3 CC and IFNL4 TT/TT (IFNL3 and IFNL4 favourable), Group 1; 11 patients were IFNL3 CT or TT and IFNL4 TT/TT (IFNL3 unfavourable and IFNL4 favourable), Group 2; 14 patients were IFNL3 CT or TT and IFNL4 TT/ΔG or ΔG/ΔG (IFNL3 and IFNL4 unfavourable), Group 3.The median levels of IFNAR-1 mRNA in PBMC from patients with the various IFNL3 and IFNL4 genotype combinations are shown in Fig. 2 Panel A. As can be seen (Fig. 2 Panel A) PBMC from patients with favourable combination at both IFNL3 and IFNL4 loci contain higher levels of IFNAR-1 mRNA as compared to the other groups. In particular, the most prominent difference (2.6 fold) was observed for Group 1 vs Group 3 [median: 1.466 (IQR: 1.025–1.655) vs 0.564 (IQR: 0.458–0.913); p = 0.0006]; an 1.51 fold difference was observed vs Group 2 [median:0.969 (IQR: 0.540–1.137); p = 0.0149]; the difference between Group 2 and Group 3 was not statistically significant [p = 0.1628].

Fig 2 Levels of IFNAR-1 mRNA in PBMC from the HCV-infected naïve subjects grouped according to their IFNL3 and IFNL4 genotype combinations.
Panel A. Group 1: IFNL3 CC and IFNL4 TT/TT (IFNL3 favourable, IFNL4 favourable), n = 8; Group 2: IFNL3 CT or TT and IFNL4 TT/TT (IFNL3 unfavourable and IFNL4 favourable) n = 10; Group 3: IFNL3 CT or TT and IFNL4 TT/ΔG or ΔG/ΔG (IFNL3 and IFNL4 unfavourable) n = 14. The results are expressed as ratio to beta-actin (median, IQR). Levels of IP10 mRNA in PBMC from the various groups after 3h of exposure to 103 IU/ml IFN-alpha2b in vitro, according to their IFNL3 and IFNL4 genotype combinations. Panel B. Group 1: IFNL3 CC and IFNL4 TT/TT (IFNL3 favourable, IFNL4 favourable) n = 6; Group 2: IFNL3 CT or TT and IFNL4 TT/TT (IFNL3 unfavourable and IFNL4 favourable) n = 11; Group 3: IFNL3 CT or TT and IFNL4 TT/ΔG or ΔG/ΔG (IFNL3 and IFNL4 unfavourable) n = 11. The results are expressed as ratio to beta-actin, after subtraction of values from unexposed cultures (median, IQR). The range of IP10 mRNA levels in unexposed PBMC cultures was 0,375 to 0,967. To explore whether the differences in the levels of IFNAR-1 mRNA could lead to an increased response to exogenously administered IFN-alpha, PBMC from patients with the various genotype combinations were exposed to IFN-alpha and the induction of mRNA for IP10, as biomarker of IFN activity, was measured. The results, shown in Fig. 2 Panel B, indicate a gradient of IFN response among the groups in term of IP10 mRNA induction, that paralleled the levels of IFNAR-1 expressed before IFN-alpha treatment (Fig. 2 Panel A). In particular, the difference between Group 1 and Group 3 was highly significant [median: 37.28 (IQR: 33.53–38.37) vs 16.06 (IQR: 9.979–29.27); p = 0.0193]. IFNAR-1 mRNA levels were not significantly modified by IFN-alpha treatment (Fig. 3), reflecting the differences among groups observed at baseline.

Fig 3 Levels of IFNAR-1 mRNA in PBMC from the HCV-infected naïve subjects after 3h of exposure to 103 IU/ml IFN-alpha2b in vitro, according to their IFNL3 and IFNL4 genotype combinations.
Group 1: IFNL3 CC and IFNL4 TT/TT (IFNL3 favourable, IFNL4 favourable) n = 6; Group 2: IFNL3 CT or TT and IFNL4 TT/TT (IFNL3 unfavourable and IFNL4 favourable) n = 11; Group 3: IFNL3 CT or TT and IFNL4 TT/ΔG or ΔG/ΔG (IFNL3 and IFNL4 unfavourable) n = 11. The results are expressed as ratio to beta-actin, after subtraction of values from unexposed cultures (median, IQR). Several studies confirmed the importance of IFNL3 SNPs in the kinetics of HCV RNA decay and, ultimately, in the response to PEG-IFN plus RBV treatment [14,15]. In addition, IFNL3 genotype has been correlated with the expression of IFN-lambda receptor-1 and with non-responsiveness to IFN-alpha therapy [33].Recently, a polymorphism within the gene encoding IFNL4 protein (ss469415590 TT or ΔG), in strong linkage disequilibrium with rs12979860 polymorphism, has been described, being more strongly associated with HCV clearance and treatment outcome than the previous one [18,19].More recently, IFNL4 genotype has also been shown to be correlated with the probability of virus eradication in patients receiving IFN-free therapy [34]. Based on these evidences and considering a previous study in which our group observed higher levels of IFNAR-1 mRNA in PBMC from patients with favourable IFNL3 genotype [31], we extended the analysis to IFNL4 polymorphisms, considering also the combination of alleles at both IFNL3 and IFNL4 loci.Our results highlighted a significantly higher expression (1.82 fold) of IFNAR-1 mRNA in PBMC from patients carrying IFNL4 TT/TT genotype vs patients carrying the ΔG allele. More interestingly, the most prominent difference of IFNAR-1 mRNA levels was observed between patients with the most favourable combination at both IFNL3 and IFNL4 loci with respect to patients with combinations involving any unfavourable allele. Overall, the difference between the favourable and unfavourable combinations at both loci was much stronger than that observed for the single polymorphisms at each locus, i.e. 2.6 fold for the combination vs 1.82 fold for IFNL4 (present study) and 2.3 fold for IFNL3 [31].The higher expression of IFNAR-1 in the favourable combination is biologically relevant, since it is connected with a stronger response to IFN-alpha exposure in vitro, in terms of IP10 mRNA induction.One limitation of this study is that we could not evaluate any correlation between IFNL3 and IFNL4 genotypes, baseline levels of IFNAR-1 and therapeutic response, since only few patients included in this study underwent IFN-based treatment so far (12 overall, 4 SVR and 8 non SVR).The findings from the present study, if confirmed in larger studies and supported by treatment outcome data, may offer a key for elucidating the biological basis of the advantage represented by IFNL3 and IFNL4 favourable genotypes towards natural or therapy-induced HCV clearance."
