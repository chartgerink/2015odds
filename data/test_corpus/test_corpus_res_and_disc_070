"Prevalence of HBV in Viet Nam In total, 8654 specimens collected from eight well defined population groups in 5 different geographical regions were analysed for evidence of HIV, HBV and HCV infection. Of these, 10.7% (n = 925) tested positive for HBsAg, with a prevalence ranging from 9.4% in the lower risk groups (pregnant women, military recruits, patients admitted for elective surgery and blood donors) to a significantly elevated 17.4% (p<0.0001) in the IDU group (Figure 1). Notably, there was a high prevalence in the renal dialysis groups throughout the country (14.3%) and this was significantly higher than in the lower risk groups (p<0.0001). 10% of a subset of HBsAg positive samples further analysed tested positive for HBcIgM (n = 27/272), although many were weakly positive. Fifty percent of 110 HBsAg negative specimens, collected from all patient groups, had detectable anti-HBc demonstrating a significant number of resolved HBV infections. HBV DNA was undetectable in the 110 HBsAg negative specimens. Blood-Borne Virus Coinfections In total, 58% of HBsAg positive IDUs and 22% of HBsAg positive CSWs had evidence of infection with at least one other blood-borne virus (Figure 2). Of 273 HBsAg positive specimens identified in the high risk study groups, coinfection with HIV was demonstrated in 28% of IDUs (n = 49/174; Figure 2) and 15.2% of CSWs (n = 15/99). Furthermore, HCV Ab/Ag was demonstrated in 89.8% of the HIV-HBV coinfections in IDUs (n = 44/49) and in 40% in CSW (n = 16/40). Evaluation of HBV-HIV coinfected patients revealed no significant differences in the mean HBV viral load or percentage of HBeAg negatives, compared to HBV monoinfected individuals (5.19 vs 5.23 Log10 IU/ml; 60% vs 59%). 10.7% (n = 34/318) of HBsAg positive specimens were positive for anti-HDV total antibody. The highest prevalence of total antibody was identified in IDUs (25.6%, n = 20/78; Figure 2), followed by military recruits (17.8%, n = 8/45), CSWs (8.8%, n = 5/57) and in a single dialysis patient (2.4%, n = 1/41). Anti-HDV total was not identified in any of the remaining low risk groups. Of note, 17.9% (n = 14/78) of HBSAg positive IDUs were quadruply infected with HBV-HIV-HCV-HDV. In HBV-HDV infected individuals, the mean HBV viral load was lower (4.2 Log10 IU/ml) and the seroconversion of HBeAg was higher (71%) when compared to HBV monoinfected individuals (5.2 Log10 IU/ml, 59% HBeAg negative, p = 0.194). 33% of 21 delta virus total antibody positive specimens were HDV IgM positive, all with low (<2.5 Log10 IU/ml) or undetectable HBV viral load. Molecular Analysis 73% (n = 273/376) of HBsAg specimens screened had detectable HBV viral load and the mean viral load was 5.21±2.56 Log10 IU/ml. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all individuals were infected with either genotype B or genotype C, and four distinct subgenotypes were identified (Figure 3). HBV subgenotype B4 (82.6%) predominated. Other genotypes detected included B2 (2.7%), C1 (14.6%) and C5 (0.5%). The newly described HBV putative “genotype I” was not detected. The presence of HBeAg correlated significantly with viral load and the mean viral load in HBeAg positive samples was 7.58 Log10 IU/ml compared to 3.32 Log10 IU/ml in HBeAg negatives (p<0.0001; Table 1). Patients with HBeAg negative infection were on average significantly older (mean 32.7 vs 24.1 years; p<0.0001), had significantly lower or undetectable HBV DNA levels (DNA detected 65% vs 7%; p<0.01), and were more likely to be infected with genotype B (87.8% vs 79.7%; p = 0.29) than those who had HBeAg positive infection (Table 1). Genetic Variation within the Surface Antigen Region 187 HBV sequences were analysed for the presence of deletions and mutations in the surface gene. One or more point mutations were identified within the immunodominant ‘a’ region in 31% (n = 58/187) of samples analysed. Mutations associated with immune escape were identified in 23.5% (n = 45/187) samples and included the following residues Y100C (n = 6), T118K (n = 1), P120L/Q/S/T (n = 10), T123A/N (n = 2), I126N/S (n = 8), P127S (n = 2), Q129R (n = 2), G130D/N/R (n = 1), T131I (n = 4), M133L/T (n = 18), G144E (n = 1) and G145A/R (n = 4). Sixty-four specimens had mutations in the T cell epitope (including N40N/S, L42L/P, G44D/E/G, A45T, P46H, T47A/E/K/T). In the preS2 region, 5.5% of specimens had a point mutation in the start codon which changed the amino acid to I (3.3%), V (1.7%) or T (0.55%), and 5.3% had a mutation at F22L with either a single or dual point mutation at this site. Deletions were found in 5% (n = 9/187) of S gene sequences, ranging from 6 to 57 nucleotides in length. One sample had two deletions of 9 and 57 nucleotides in different regions of the preS1 and preS2 genes, and another sample had a deletion which involved the preS2 start codon. The majority of these S gene deletions were identified in the genomes of high risk IDUs and CSWs (n = 8). No significant difference in history of vaccination was identified in individuals whose sequences contained mutations associated with immune escape (18.6%, n = 8/42) compared to sequences that did not (24%, n = 35/99; p = 0.431). Drug Resistance Mutations Of 376 HBsAg positive specimens, only 19 (5%) were from individuals who reported having received treatment. All were coinfected with HIV and were receiving lamivudine as a component of HAART. 78.9% (n = 15/19) of these individuals had undetectable HBV viral loads and, of the 4 patients on HAART with a detectable HBV viral load, one – a HIV/HBV/HCV coinfected IDU – had drug resistance associated mutations, L180M and M204V in the pol gene conferring resistance to lamivudine and possible resistance to telbivudine. Analysis of other HBsAg positive and HIV Ag/Ab negative specimens (n = 165) did not reveal the presence of drug resistance associated mutations. Precore Mutations Analysis of mutations in the basal core promoter and precore regions showed significant variation with genotype. 35% of all specimens had the precore stop mutation G1896A which abrogates HBeAg production; however, this was detected in 41% of genotype B compared to only 3% of genotype C viruses (p<0.0001; Figure 4). In contrast, the basal core promoter mutations A1762T and G1764A were detected more frequently in genotype C at 49% and 51% respectively, compared to only 22% and 18% in genotype B (p<0.0001). 1858C was detected only in genotype C viruses (n = 36). Evaluation of fragments for which there was an available corresponding S gene sequence also identified a difference in mutational patterns at the subgenotype level: B2 viruses compared to B4 for both G1896A (20%, n = 1/5 vs 40.2%, n = 53/132) and A1762T/G1764A (40%, n = 2/5 vs 19.7%, n = 26/132). We also identified a 21 bp deletion in the basal core promoter region of one sequence from a 55 year-old multi-transfused patient in Khanh Hoa (JQ281259). Genetic Variability at the IL28B Locus HBsAg positive individuals (n = 368) from the five centres were genotyped for the IL28B SNP rs12979860 and the C allele frequency was found to be 93%. Overall, 86.41% (n = 318) were major homozygotes [CC], 13.04% (n = 48) were heterozygotes [CT] and 0.54% (n = 2) were minor homozygotes [TT]. A comparison of all monoinfected HBsAg positive individuals (n = 214) with individuals with resolved infection (i.e. HBsAg negative, HBc total positive and HBV DNA negative; n = 53) demonstrated no significant difference in genotype frequency (p = 0.50). Furthermore, HBV viral load was not significantly influenced by rs12979860 genotype (p = 0.24; Table 2) and multivariate regression analysis confounding for age and sex did not reveal a statistically significant association between the IL28B SNP and HBeAg positive and negative individuals (p = 0.06). It is now clear that, as in many countries in Southeast Asia, HBV is endemic in Viet Nam and contributes to a significant burden of liver disease in the country. The present report provides one of the most comprehensive studies of HBV in Viet Nam to date, involving distinct geographical regions and populations with different risk factors for infection. The clinical outcome of HBV infection and the response to treatment and vaccination is influenced by a number of factors including coinfection with other blood-borne viruses, viral genotype, virus specific mutations in the pre-core and basal core promoter regions of the genome and a number of host factors. The present study has involved molecular analysis to analyse viral load, viral genotype and core and pre-core mutants. In addition our studies have examined coinfections with other blood-borne viruses including HIV, HCV and HDV – all of which would be expected to impact on HBV pathogenesis, and on the overall development and progression of liver disease.The results of this study have confirmed the high level of endemicity of HBV in Viet Nam. As expected, levels of HBsAg are highest in the higher risk groups such as IDUs and CSWs, however, levels were also elevated in the dialysis cohorts from each region. Core IgM was detected in 27 samples and, while this may be suggestive of acute infection, confirmation is difficult due to the possibility of persistent detectable IgM in chronic infection. Serological analysis of HBsAg negative samples in eight groups in the study also demonstrated that some 50% of individuals tested had evidence of resolved HBV infection.Our study also identified a very high prevalence of blood-borne viral coinfections. As expected, this was most evident in the IDU cohort, where serological analysis revealed that 53%, 28% and 26% of hepatitis B infected participants were coinfected with HCV, HIV and HDV, respectively. In fact, a significant proportion of these individuals had either triple or quadruple infections, with 18% of hepatitis B infected IDU patients infected with HIV, HCV and HDV. The prevalence of coinfection in the sex worker cohort, although marked, was less significant with 10%, 15% and 9% of the hepatitis B infected participants also infected with HCV, HIV and HDV, respectively. In contrast, there was little evidence of coinfections in the hepatitis B infected participants from lower risk groups.High levels of HIV-HBV coinfection have significant implications for the introduction of HAART for HIV treatment. Our results suggest that it would be advisable that all HIV infected individuals in Viet Nam, if possible, should be screened for active HBV infection. A recent study from the US has shown that patients with chronic HBV, as defined by HBsAg positivity, had a much higher risk for developing the composite outcome of an AIDS-defining illness or death compared to individuals who were HBV negative [64]. Studies from South Africa have indicated that lamivudine, when employed as a sole HBV active drug in a HAART regimen, may not reliably suppress HBV replication [65]. As such, at least two drugs with anti-HBV activity (tenofovir plus lamivudine or plus emtricitabine) should be employed in the setting of HIV-HBV coinfection [66]. Indeed, tenofovir-based regimens are now being introduced as front line therapy of HIV infections in Viet Nam. This would also be expected to prevent the development of HBV resistance which can occur when single agents are employed, as we have found in the present study. Monitoring of such treatment should also, if possible be accompanied by measurement of both HIV and HBV viral loads to assess the efficacy of treatment. In addition to specific treatments, efforts should be enhanced to provide HBV vaccination to individuals with or at risk of HIV infection.The present study also demonstrated significant levels of HDV infection. The overall prevalence across the cohorts of 10.7% (patients infected with HBV coinfected with HDV) is in a marked contrast to previous reports in Viet Nam, where rates of approximately 1% were described [11], [40]. The variation in HBV-HDV coinfection rates across the cohorts could be stratified between high and low risk exposure groups, with the vast majority of HDV infections occurring in the IDU and CSW cohorts. The difference between this and previous studies most likely reflects the inclusion of these defined high risk cohorts from urban centres. Molecular analysis of HBV DNA in HBV-HDV coinfected participants showed a significant reduction in detectable HBV viral load and a higher rate of e antigen negativity, when compared to the HBV monoinfected cohort. Our findings suggest that levels of HDV exposure in Viet Nam are significantly higher than previously recognised and that the burden of liver disease associated with HBV-HDV infection may be more substantial than previously thought.Molecular studies demonstrated that HBV genotypes B4 and C1 predominated, but there were also smaller levels of B2 and C5. In agreement with a previous study, we did not identify the putative genotype I, suggesting that this recombinant remains rare in Viet Nam [46]. The lack of proofreading ability of the HBV polymerase, together with the high viral titre in active HBV infection, results in a high mutation rate during virus replication. Genetic mutations and deletions in the pre-S and basal core promoter regions of the HBV genome including T1753V, A1762T, G1764A, and C1766T have been associated with more severe liver disease and the development of HCC [67], [68]. The basal core promoter mutations 1762T/W and 1764A/R were detected in 26% and 24% of specimens, respectively. Previous reports of heterogeneity in the BCP/PC region of HBV in Viet Nam identified prevalence rates of up to 32% 1753C/A, 68% 1762T/1764A, 70% 1858C and 12% 1896A in genotype C viruses compared to 28% 1762T/1764A, 0% 1858C and 34% 1896A in genotype B [69], [70]. We identified the precore stop mutation G1896A in 35% (n = 82/236) of all samples, and this varied significantly with viral genotype, with a higher incidence in genotype B compared to genotype C, which is in agreement with previous studies [69], [70]. Contrastingly, the basal core promoter mutations 1762T and 1764A were detected more frequently in genotype C than in genotype B, and 1858C was identified only in genotype C viruses. Although the numbers were too low to reach statistical significance, we also identified a difference in the G1896A and A1762T/G1764A mutations at the subgenotype level, which has also been previously reported [71].Of increasing concern is the emergence of mutations in epitopes of the HBV S gene which have been associated with immune escape [47]. As the HBV pol gene overlaps the S gene, mutations in the pol gene could result in non-synonymous mutations in the corresponding open reading frame. Thus, mutational pressure on the pol gene may potentially alter the antigenic characteristics of the surface protein, which could in turn alter vaccine efficacy and affect serological diagnostic assays targeting this region. We have found that 31% of our sequences contained mutations in the immunodominant region of the S gene and have identified a high number of potential immune escape mutants. Of particular note, 2.2% of sequences analysed contained the major vaccine escape mutation G145A as a dominant or as a mixed population. Analysis of the preS region demonstrated that a total of 5% of specimens had preS deletions (primarily identified in high risk individuals), 5.5% contained amino acid mutations in the start codon of the preS2 and 5.3% had an F22L mutation in the preS2, all of which have been significantly associated with the development of HCC [68].The role of host immunogenetics in influencing the rates of spontaneous HBV clearance and the development of persistent infection is poorly understood. IL28B genetic variants have previously been associated with natural and therapy-associated clearance of HCV [48], [72]–[74]. In contrast, recent studies have found no significant differences in IL28B allele frequencies between individuals who spontaneously clear or those who develop a persistent HBV infection [49], [50]. Interestingly, a Chinese study by Li and colleagues demonstrated an association between the rs12979860 CC genotype (associated with a favourable HCV response to therapy and higher natural clearance rates) with elevated IL28B protein levels in serum and with lower HBV viral loads (<105 copies/ml) compared to both CT and TT genotypes. IL28B genotype has also recently been implicated in rates of HBeAg seroconversion (appearance of anti-HBe) following interferon-α treatment and also HBsAg clearance after follow up, although the latter effect was modest and further studies are required to corroborate these findings [51], [52]. In our study, comprising untreated, HBV monoinfected Vietnamese individuals, we did not observe a significant association between the IL28B genotype and clearance of HBsAg or variation in HBV DNA levels. Although we noted an association between Il28B and HBeAg status, this did not reach statistical significance which may be due to the low T allele frequency (7%) in Viet Nam. Our analysis does not exclude a role for this locus in influencing HBV viral replication and disease progression; however, our results suggest that, unlike the effect noted for spontaneous clearance of HCV, this host variant does not exert a strong influence on the course of HBV infection.In conclusion, a number of studies including the present have clearly shown that Viet Nam is facing a huge burden of HBV related liver disease. Thus, the enhancement of HBV screening efforts in Viet Nam, in association with both vaccination and, if economically possible, treatment for chronic infection, should be prioritised to limit the future impact of serious liver disease. Moreover, in HIV infected individuals, testing for HBV should be implemented. Currently recommended treatment of coinfected individuals with a tenofovir-based regimen would provide effective therapy for both viruses and would be expected to prevent the emergence of HBV drug resistance mutations."
