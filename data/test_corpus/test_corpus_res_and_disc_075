"Characteristics of the Study Group
The study group consisted of 90 patients: 69 with HCV mono-and 21 with HIV/HCV coinfection, of whom 27 were women and 63 were men. The median age of patients was 30 years (LQ 29 years-UQ34 years).
Among subjects with HIV/HCV co-infection 16 were receiving antiretroviral treatment, while 5 were not. The median CD4 cell count was 405 cells/µL (LQ 339 cells/µL–UQ 469 cells/µL). All patients had CD4 cell count >200 cells/µL, 14 patients had CD4 cell count >350 cells/µL. Fifteen patients demonstrated an HIV viral load below 50 copies/mL. The highest HIV viral load amounted to 385 000 copies/mL.
The comparison between patients with and without HIV/HCV co-infection is depicted in table 1. In the group of co-infected patients, a higher incidence of infection with HCV genotypes 3 and 4, and a lower incidence of infection with genotype 1, was observed compared to the group with HCV mono–infection.

HMOX1
HMOX1 expression was analyzed in 90 liver biopsy samples. Eight specimens were rejected because of the insufficient RNA amount or quality (A260/A280<1.8).
A lower expression of HMOX1 was observed in patients co-infected with HIV/HCV. Expression of this gene was also lower in patients with lower HCV viral load (table 2). As regards the studied genotypes, a lower expression of HMOX1 was detected in patients infected with HCV genotype 4 in comparison with patients infected with HCV genotype 1. Results of the W-Blot confirm the described correlations (figure 1). While a strong band for HO-1 was observed in 4 out of 5 subjects with HCV viremia higher than 600 000 IU/ml, a weak band for HO-1 was observed in 3 out of 5 patients with HCV viremia below 600 000 IU/ml.

Figure 1 depicts the results of selected patients Only in some patients with co-infection no visible bands of HO-1 were seen (lane 5,6). Anti GAPDH antibody was used to confirm equal presence of cellular material in each sample. Subgroup of Patients with Co-infection
Higher expression of HO-1 was found in patients with CD4 count >350 cells/µl and HIV viral load <50 copies/ml (table 3). The presented results of the W-Blot confirmed this correlation on the protein level.

No band was observed in patients with CD4 count below 350 cells/ul and detectable HIV viremia.

The results of gene expression indicate a positive correlation between HO-1 and Bach-1. Higher HMOX1 expression correlated with a higher expression of Bach-1(Spearman’s ρ = 0.586, p = 0.000001) figure 3. Such a correlation was also confirmed by the W-Blot analysis, and selected results are presented in figure 4. Both in patients with mono- and coinfection, a weak band for Bach-1 was associated with a weak band for HO-1, and a strong band for Bach-1 was observed in the presence of a strong band for HO-1. Similarly, in coinfected patients in whom no band for HO-1 was observed, no band for Bach-1 was found.

2.19 ALT - alanine aminotransferase, genotypes of IL28B: CC and not CC (CT and TT). In liver biopsy: G- grade of inflammation and necrosis, S-stage of fibrosis.The HCV core protein is considered to cause increased production of ROS by altering mitochondrial function [19]. Controlled ROS production might be beneficial because it supports the elimination of HCV [7]. On the other hand, excessive production of ROS can result in hepatocyte injury. Therefore it is crucial to maintain a balance between pro-and antioxidative processes. HO-1 is one of the principal antioxidative enzymes. It is a cytoprotective enzyme which catalyzes the degradation of heme to bilirubin, carbon monoxide and iron and is induced by its substrate, heme, and by other stress-induced molecules [13], [20], [21].Some authors suggested that different HCV proteins induce different antioxidant defense responses in hepatocytes. Abdalla et al [22], [23] showed that the expression of HO-1 was reduced in cell lines that stably expressed HCV core protein but increased in cell lines over-expressing HCV-NS proteins. On the contrary, Ghazini [16] demonstrates that HO-1 is up-regulated in hepatoma cells expressing not only HCV core protein but also additional structural and nonstructural proteins.HO-1 has been shown to interfere with HCV replication but this connection is not yet clear. Several studies indicate that HO-1 induction or overexpression in replicons inhibit HCV replication [14], [15], while others have specified that it might be the products of the reaction catalyzed by HO-1 that are responsible for this process. It has been demonstrated that both iron and biliverdin display antiviral activity [24]–[27]. However, on the contrary, Kakizaki et al [28] note that iron enhances hepatitis C virus replication in cultured human hepatocytes. The present study demonstrates that HMOX1 expression positively correlated with HCV viremia in patients with CHC, and that expression was higher in patients with HCV viremia values greater than 600 000 IU/mL than in those with lower levels.The mechanism of HMOX1 up-regulation in HCV infection is not precisely known, although it may be the result of a protective antioxidant response to excessive ROS production. One of the models explaining the increased expression of HMOX1 in patients with CHC was presented by Ghazani et al [16], who postulate that during HCV infection, the expression of Bach-1 gene is decreased, which causes de-repression of HMOX1. Bach-1 downregulation might be connected with oxidative stress, and HMOX1 induction could be a part of the response that hepatocytes use to protect themselves against oxidative stress.However, the results of the present study do not indicate that a higher expression of Bach-1 is associated with a lower expression of HMOX1. On the contrary, Bach-1 positively correlated with HO-1. The W-Blot analysis provided similar results: patients in whom no band for HO-1 was observed also had a weak or absent band for Bach-1 and conversely, in those who had a strong band for HO-1, a band for Bach-1 was also found. Hence Bach-1 does not seem to play a role in the repression of HMOX1 in patients infected with HCV.MiRNAs are post-transcriptional regulators which bind to complementary sequences on target messenger RNA transcripts. Several hundred miRNAs have already been distinguished and each of them is considered to regulate hundreds of target mRNAs. MiR-122, the most abundant miRNA in the liver, is known to positively regulate replication of the HCV in cell culture [29], [30]. However, no correlation between the expression of miR-122 and HCV viremia in patients with CHC was identified in the present study. Similarly, Sarasin-Filipowicz [17] report no positive correlation between miR-122 expression and intrahepatic and serum viral load in patients with CHC.Some papers suggest that the antiviral effects of IFN in treatment of patients with CHC may be connected with the influence of IFN on miR-122. Pedersen [31] confirms that IFN-beta stimulation of Huh7 cells leads to a significant reduction in the expression of the liver-specific miR-122. However, Sarasin-Filipowicz [17] reports that the level of miR-122 in liver biopsies did not change significantly between before starting pegylated IFN-α treatment and 4 h afterwards. Interestingly, a study by Sarasin-Filipowicz [17] suggests that the role of miR-122 in controlling the HCV replication might be less important in vivo than in vitro.It is worthy of note that miRNAs can also be involved in the regulation of HO-1. In our study, a positive correlation between miR-122 and HMOX1 was observed. Higher HMOX1 correlated with higher miR-122 expression. Additionally, it can be seen that a higher expression of HMOX1 implies a higher HCV viremia. Our results may suggest that in patients with CHC, miR-122 can regulate HCV replication partly through modulation of HMOX1 expression. Another possible explanation of the correlation between miR-122 and HMOX1 is that miR-122 indirectly increases oxidative stress and consequently leads to a protective increase of HMOX1 expression by affecting HCV replication. However, a fuller investigation of these correlations should be the subject of later studies.The expression of HMOX1 was found to be higher in patients with lower gradings in liver biopsy specimens (G<2), which may suggest that the enzyme plays a protective, anti-inflammatory role. Conversely, HMOX1 expression was lowest in patients with HIV/HCV co-infection, especially those with lower CD4 lymphocyte counts and higher HIV viral loads, which is disadvantageous.Lower expression of HMOX1 in patients with HIV/HCV co-infection can indicate a weaker antioxidative response to oxidative stress in this group of patients. Some authors suggest that HO-1 induction may counteract the effects of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and proinflammatory cytokines in HIV infection [32]."
