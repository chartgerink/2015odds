"Bioinformatics Analysis of the IL28 gene region confirmed 97.5% sequence identity between the coding exons and introns of the IL28A and IL28B genes. In addition, the analysis also showed that a 7.3 kb region extending both upstream and downstream of the two genes shared greater than 95% sequence identity (illustrated in Figure 1). Six of the 9 reported SNPs associated with pegylated interferon treatment response in HCV patients were located within this 7.3 kb block and each of these SNPs matched regions present in the DNA sequence surrounding IL28A (Figure 2). Interestingly, one of the 2 alleles across each 6 SNP locations in the IL28B reference sequence (NCBI Genome Build 37) exactly matched the corresponding position in IL28A and the ancestral allele. For example, for rs12979860 the two alleles reported for this SNP were C and T. The reference nucleotide at this location in IL28B was C, whereas it was a T in the reverse complement of IL28A and the ancestral allele was also a T. This finding, together with the high levels of sequence identity across the 7.3 kb region, raised theoretical questions about the potential specificity of genotyping assays for 6 of the 9 reported SNPs. To address this matter, a PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing approach was taken to obtain definitive DNA sequence data to confirm the presence of SNPs in IL28B and to enable assay development for the most cosmopolitan SNP, rs12979860. 10.1371/journal.pone.0029983.g001 Figure 1 Schematic showing IL28 genes, SNP locations and areas of sequence homology. Illustration of the relative locations of the IL28A and IL28B genes on the forward and reverse DNA strands on chromosome 19. The shaded boxes indicate regions of the inverted duplication with >95% sequence identity. The direction of the shaded gradient indicates the orientation of the match. SNP identifiers in blue were unique to the IL28B region, whereas SNPs highlighted in other colors were present in the IL28B region as well as a corresponding region in IL28A. 10.1371/journal.pone.0029983.g002 Figure 2 Sequence alignments surrounding six of the treatment response associated SNPs. Alignment comparing 50 bp sequence surrounding SNP locations in IL28B reference sequence from NCBI genome build 37 and the corresponding reverse complement regions of IL28A reference sequence (RC ref). SNP identifiers (color coded to match Figure 1) and their respective alleles are shown. Ancestral alleles were obtained from dbSNP, except for those indicated by +; in these cases, the allele was based upon alignment of gorilla, chimpanzee, macaque and orangutan sequences. SNP locations on each alignment are highlighted in red. The asterisk denotes sequence identity. Sequence analysis For each of 48 different DNA samples, 8 regions spanning SNPs within and surrounding IL28B, as well as the corresponding regions of IL28A, were amplified by PCR and the resulting products were sequenced directly using BigDye® terminator chemistry (Applied Biosystems Inc.). Sequences were assembled to provide a consensus sequence for each PCR fragment and the alleles at each SNP location identified. All 9 SNPs previously identified that were associated with pegylated interferon treatment response were found to be polymorphic, whereas the 6 overlapping regions in IL28A were all monomorphic (Tables 3 and 4). Allele frequencies for the CEU, JPT and YRI populations were similar to those reported in dbSNP. 10.1371/journal.pone.0029983.t003Table 3 Allele frequencies of SNPs unique to IL28B region.

Of these 17 SNPs, all were present in non-coding regions except for one, E95Q, that was present in an IL28B protein-coding exon. The novel SNPs were all confirmed in double stranded sequence. Each SNP was a heterozygote and they were only present in one or two individual samples (Table S2). Assay for rs12979860 rs12979860 has become the most widely studied SNP in the HCV field since the original publications reporting the results of genome-wide association studies. Using the consensus DNA sequence of the fragment containing this SNP, a sensitive TaqMan® based assay was developed. The specificity of the assay was driven by the amplification primers (Figure 3). Specifically, the forward primer had 4 base mismatches compared to IL28A, including the final base at the terminal 3′ end, and the reverse primer had 3 base mismatches. Although the VIC-labeled probe sequence was common to both IL28A and IL28B, the specific amplification of IL28B allowed for gene-specific discrimination as illustrated in Figure 4. 10.1371/journal.pone.0029983.g003 Figure 3 Sequence alignment of IL28B and IL28A used to design the rs12979860 genotyping assay.

Allelic discrimination plot generated by the SDS 2.3 software (Applied Biosystems Inc.) for the rs12979860 genotyping assay using the 48 sample DNA panel. Red and blue circles represent the two homozygous genotypes (T/T and C/C), the green circles represent heterozygous genotype (C/T) and the black squares represent no template control. The TaqMan® assay gave results that were 100% concordant with the sequence based data using the 48 DNA samples previously examined. To determine the lower confidence limits of the concordance, a Beta distribution was used. The distribution of underlying true probabilities generating ‘s’ successes in ‘n’ trials is given by Beta(p, s+1, n–s+1), and this was used to determine that the underlying 99% and 95% lower confidence limits on concordance were 91.03% and 94.07%, respectively. The genotype results of all 48 Coriell Institute DNA samples are listed in the Table S3), alongside sequence traces used to make the rs12979860 genotype calls (Figure S2). Comparison with other data sources HapMap data for rs12979860 was available for the JPT and YRI samples (Table S3). Genotypes for 30 of 32 samples were 100% concordant, with no data available for two samples. In addition, a subset of 24 out of the 48 DNA samples were also analyzed by Monogram Biosciences Inc. using a commercial assay developed by LabCorp Inc. The results were concordant for 23 out of 24 samples analyzed (Table S3). The discordant sample (Coriell identifier NA18502) was a C/T heterozygote in both the Sanger sequencing and TaqMan assays, but called a T/T homozygote in the LabCorp assay. This sample was one of the two HapMap samples with missing data. To confirm that there had been no sample mix-up with NA18502 in the author's lab, a total of 8 SNPs from 4 chromosomes were determined in addition to a gender marker. All 9 markers were fully concordant with HapMap data suggesting that there was <1% chance of a sample mix up (Table S4). Upon further analysis at Monogram Biosciences Inc., the T/T signals obtained for sample NA18502 were found to be inconsistent with the normal distribution of T/T results observed in the assay. The interpretation algorithm now used at Monogram Biosciences Inc. has been modified to account for this variant result. The Coriell Institute DNA samples are publically available, therefore the same samples could be used in the future to benchmark newly developed assays. Genome-wide association studies have demonstrated that SNPs found in the region surrounding IL28B were associated with response of patients infected with HCV to treatment with pegylated interferon-α (with or without ribavirin) [4]–[6] and with spontaneous clearance of HCV infection [7]. Over the last two years, the number of publications examining IL28B SNPs has increased tremendously and treatment options based upon a patient's IL28B SNP genotype are being considered [8], [9].The IL28B gene has a close paralogue, IL28A, with which it shares 97.5% sequence identity. This raised the possibility that sequences in IL28A may contribute to the determination of IL28B SNP genotypes. Therefore, understanding genotype assay specificity would be vitally important to consider when using IL28B genotypes to make treatment decisions. Clinicians need to be confident that ‘homebrew’ assays are robust and fully validated to allow prospective genotyping to make treatment decisions on single subjects rather than assays for retrospective cohort-based analyses.The IL28A and IL28B genes likely arose due to an ancestral gene duplication and inversion event, with IL28A being located on the positive DNA strand of chromosome 19 and IL28B 24 kb downstream on the negative strand. Although these genes are 97.5% identical across their 1.4 kb length, a region of >95% sequence identity stretches a total of 7.3 kb in both 5′ and 3′ directions and it includes 6 of the 9 reported treatment response associated SNPs. Our observation that in all cases, one of the two alleles of the IL28B SNPs also corresponded to identical nucleotides in IL28A led us to take a sequence-based approach in order to confirm SNP genotypes. Sequencing specific regions from a panel of DNA samples from 48 individuals representing CEU, JPT and YRI origins demonstrated that all 9 SNPs in the IL28B region were polymorphic, whereas the corresponding sequences in IL28A were all monomorphic. Despite this finding, there was still the potential for IL28A sequences to contribute to genotyping calls if assays were not sufficiently specific.As a general rule when developing PCR-based genotyping assays, the greater the number of mismatches between the target primers and other homologous sequences, the greater the assay specificity. SNP rs12979860 currently appears to be the best single choice variant for diagnostic purposes across global populations or for use in clinical trials [8] and as a result, it has now become the most studied SNP of the 9 treatment response associated SNPs that were initially identified. Our TaqMan® assay for rs12979860 used two PCR primers that contained 3 and 4 base mismatches per primer compared to the corresponding IL28A sequences. This assay gave 100% concordant results to the sequence-derived genotypes. Whilst not implying that published rs12979860 assays have not been technically validated, examining a selection of different types of rs12979860 genotyping assays found varying numbers of base mismatches in the PCR amplification primers. For example, one TaqMan® assay had 0 and 3 mismatches in the amplification primer pairs [13], [14], a PCR/Sybr green assay had 0 and 2 mismatches [15], and a MELT-MAMA PCR assay had 0 and 5 mismatches [16]. In these three examples, the specificity for IL28B is only driven by a single primer. Two commercially available rs12979860 assays from LabCorp Inc and Quest Diagnostics Inc. have not reported details of their respective assay components. Analysis of a 24 sample subset of the 48 Coriell DNAs revealed one discordant genotype using the LabCorp assay; interestingly in a sample that had its genotype missing in the HapMap data. Re-analysis of this discordant data-point led to a modification of the genotype calling algorithm now used at Monogram Biosciences Inc.Given the importance of the studies being used worldwide to examine associations between SNP rs12979860 and response to treatment in various hepatitis populations, it is vitally important that robust and well validated assays are used. This is particularly important as future hepatitis patient treatment decisions will likely be dependent upon results obtained from such genotyping assays."
