"A total of 602 patients with CHC treated with PEG-IFN-α based therapy were enrolled. Of these, 368 patients (61.1%) achieved SVR. All patients were Thai. Baseline patient characteristics are shown in Table 1. There was no difference in most baseline variables between patients with SVR and non-SVR, except that patients without SVR were older and had a higher proportion of HCV genotype 1 infection, baseline HCV RNA, and advanced liver fibrosis than patients with SVR.

The genotypic distribution of the CXCL10 and IL28B variants and treatment response classified by HCV genotype are summarized in Fig 1. There was no association between rs56061981 promoter polymorphism of CXCL10 and SVR in patients with CHC genotype1 and non-genotype 1 infection (P > 0.05). By contrast, SNP at rs12979860 in IL28B predicted SVR in patients with both CHC genotype 1 (P < 0.001) and non-genotype 1 infection (P < 0.05). 10.1371/journal.pone.0137365.g001
Fig 1 CXCL10 rs56061981, IL28B rs12979860 polymorphisms according to sustained virological response (SVR) in patients with CHC infection. In the univariate analysis across all HCV genotypes, age, HCV genotype, baseline HCV RNA, liver fibrosis, and IL28B rs12979860 polymorphism was linked to treatment response. Stepwise logistic regression analysis was used to assess independent predictors for good treatment outcomes. Multivariate analysis revealed that IL28B rs12979860 CC genotype (OR = 3.12; 95% CI, 1.72–5.67; P < 0.001), HCV RNA < 400,000 IU/ml (OR = 2.21; 95% CI, 1.22–3.99; P < 0.05), age < 45 years (OR = 2.03; 95% CI, 1.11–3.68; P < 0.05) and liver fibrosis stage 0–1 (OR = 1.64; 95% CI, 1.01–2.65; P < 0.05) were independent factors for SVR. During treatment, 66.7% and 88.4% of patients had undetectable HCV RNA at week 4 (rapid virologic response or RVR) and week 12 (early virologic response or EVR), respectively. The rate of SVR was higher in patients who achieved RVR (72.3% vs. 27.7%; OR = 4.62, 95% CI, 3.07–6.98; P < 0.001) and EVR (OR = 10.74, 95% CI = 5.14–22.46, P < 0.001) than patients without RVR and EVR, respectively. Combining assessment of CXCL10 rs56061981and IL28B rs12979860 polymorphisms
Although the relationship between IL28B CT or TT genotypes and poor treatment outcome is well known, 15–30% of patients in this group achieved SVR [1, 16]. A previous study found that combining IL28B genotype and baseline IP-10 level improves the predictive value for treatment response [8]. This study demonstrated that use of the functional promoter polymorphism CXCL10 rs56061981 had an important role in predicting SVR in patients infected with CHC who had unfavorable IL28B rs12979860 CT or TT genotypes. In our study, 118 patients (19.6%) had IL28B rs12979860 CT or TT genotypes. Of these, 57.6% (n = 68) had HCV genotype1 infection. Correlation of CXCL10 rs56061981 and treatment response across total, genotype 1 and non-genotype 1 HCV infected patients who had favorable and unfavorable IL28B rs12979860 was shown in Fig 2. The CXCL10 rs56061981 non-GG genotype was associated with a higher rate of SVR achievement than GG genotype only in patients with HCV genotype 1 infection that had unfavorable IL28B rs12979860. By univariate analysis, HCV RNA < 400,000 IU/ml and CXCL10 rs56061981 polymorphism was related with SVR. Multivariate analysis showed in this group of patients, baseline CXCL10 rs56061981 non-GG genotype (OR = 4.00, 95% CI, 1.03–15.53; P = 0.045) strongly predicted SVR. 10.1371/journal.pone.0137365.g002

The prevalence of four SNPs in DPP4 gene of patients with CHC genotype 1 is shown in Fig 3. The SVR rate is not associated with DPP4 gene polymorphisms. Eighty patients with genotype 1 infection treated with PEG-IFN-α and ribavirin (40 patients with SVR and 40 patients without SVR) were evaluated for sDPP IV concentration. Baseline characteristics of these selected 80 patients compared with the remaining patients were shown in S1 Table. The selected patients had more advanced age and less history of alcohol drinking. The mean and standard deviation of sDPP IV were not different between patients who did or did not have SVR (695 ± 191 ng/ml vs. 697 ± 170 ng/ml, P = 0.67). 10.1371/journal.pone.0137365.g003

The correlation between four SNPs of DPP4 and sDPP IV concentration was assessed. There was a trend of increasing mean sDPP IV in patients with DPP4 rs 13015258 AA, AC, and CC genotypes (749, 703, and 585 ng/ml), respectively, as shown in Fig 4. Serum sDPP IV concentration were significantly higher in patients with DPP4 rs13015258 AA than in patients with the CC genotype, P = 0.006. Mean sDPP IV concentration in patients with DPP4 rs17848916 TT vs. TG genotype (694 vs. 632 ng/ml, P = 0.44) or DPP4 rs 17574 TT vs. TC genotype (709 vs. 634 ng/ml, P = 0.26) were not significantly different. All patients had DPP4 rs41268649 GG genotype; mean sDPP IV was 690 ng/ml. 10.1371/journal.pone.0137365.g004

Statistics analysis using two-tailed Mann-Whitney U-test. To our knowledge, this is the first study to attempt to demonstrate the association between functional genetic variation of CXCL10, IL28B and DPP4 and treatment outcome with PEG-IFN-α and ribavirin in Thai patients with CHC infection.The main results of the present study are:
In Thai patients infected with CHCs genotype 1 who had unfavorable IL28B rs12979860 CT or TT genotypes, using the CXCL10 rs5606198 polymorphism improved the prediction of SVR with PEG-IFN-α based therapy.
The IL28B rs12979860 CC genotype was a good predictor for SVR among Thai patients infected with CHC.
There was a high prevalence of IL28B rs12979860 CC genotype in Thai patients with CHC infection.
IP-10 is an essential chemokine, stimulating the immune response against HCV infection. A high pretreatment serum IP-10 concentration predicts treatment failure in patients with CHC infection treated with PEG-IFN-α and ribavirin therapy [5–7, 17, 18]. In acute HCV infection, high baseline levels of IP-10 are associated with failure of spontaneous clearance of HCV; patients with high baseline levels of IP-10 should therefore be considered for early therapeutic intervention [19, 20]. Serum levels and hepatic expression of IP-10 correlate with severity of liver histopathology in patients with CHC infection [21, 22]. DPP IV affects the immune system through HCV-specific T-cell activation and various chemokine modifications, including IP-10 [9, 23, 24]. Patients with HCV infection show increased serum DPP IV expression [25, 26]. High baseline sDPP IV is related to poor treatment response [11]. Previous studies have showed that functional SNPs of CXCL10 and DPP4 affect their function. However, this study demonstrated that SNPs rs56061981 in CXCL10 and rs13015258, rs17848916, rs 41268649, and rs17574 in DPP4 were not associated with treatment response in CHC-infected Thai patients treated with PEG-IFN-α based therapy. The reason for this could not be clearly identified. Possible mechanisms could arise during the process after transcription and translation or other chemokine-complex-modifying effects of IP-10 and DPP IV. The present study did not evaluate serum IP-10 because a fraction of the patients had been enrolled during or after therapy. This prevented us from evaluating pretreatment IP-10 levels and analyzing possible effects of the studied polymorphisms on serum IP-10 level. However, functional analysis from Deng G et al showed that CXCL10 rs56061981 polymorphism alters the binding affinity of nuclear protein and regulates CXCL10 expression, but does not correlate with IP-10 level [13]. In contrast, Mihm S et al found that serum IP-10 is strongly associated with CXCL10 gene expression in CHC infection [27]. We are interested in demonstrating the relationship of treatment response and the variation of host genetic factor. In healthy Chinese population, the CXCL10 rs56061981 genotypic frequencies were 86.2%, 12.7% and 1.1% for GG, GA and AA genotypes, respectively [28]. This current study found that the CXCL10 rs56061981 non-GG genotype was frequent in Thai patients with CHC compared to the healthy Chinese population. Data of the studied DPP4 polymorphisms of general population have not been reported.The IL28B rs12979860 polymorphism on chromosome 19, which encodes IFN-λ, is associated with spontaneous HCV clearance and treatment response to PEG-IFN-α and ribavirin [1, 2, 29]. The highly variable prevalence of the favorable IL28B genotype in patients of varying ethnicity, with Africans having the lowest frequencies and East Asians the highest, may explain the difference in SVR among different populations. All patients in this study were Thai, and there was a high prevalence of the favorable IL28B CC genotype (79.9%). Serum levels of IP-10 and sDPP IV improve the predictive value of IL28 variants for treatment response. Low baseline concentrations of serum IP-10 and sDPP IV improved the likelihood of achieving SVR among patients infected with CHC genotype 1 who had unfavorable IL28B rs12979860 CT and TT genotypes [8, 11]. Interestingly, this study demonstrated that genetic variant rs56061981 non-GG genotypes in the promoter region of CXCL10 is related to SVR in patients who have IL28B rs12979860 CT or TT genotypes and might contribute to a genome-based personalization therapy, even in this era of direct-acting antivirals. This study indicates that not only is serum IP-10 level a prognostic factor for SVR, but that including analysis of CXCL10 rs56061981 also improves prediction treatment response for unfavorable IL28B variants with high specificity in Thai patients with CHC genotype 1.Despite moving to the new era of CHC treatment with direct-acting antiviral agents (DAA), in most developing countries, including Thailand, where DAAs are not widely accessible, the PEG-IFN-α based treatment remains an effective therapy for CHC infection. Several factors are potential predictors for treatment response with PEG-IFN-α based regimen and may improve predictive efficiency of IL-28B genotype for treatment outcome in CHC-infected patients, including baseline γ-glutamyltransferase/alanine aminotransferase ratio, vitamin D level, serum ferritin concentration, and early anemia. However, available data are contradictory [30–35]. In this current study, we did not collect baseline γ-glutamyltransferase, serum vitamin D and ferritin. Additionally, we intended to study the association of pre-treatment factors and SVR, thus we did not include RVR or EVR in multivariate analysis for SVR. However, we found in univariate analysis that RVR and EVR during therapy predicted SVR.Our study is limited in that sDPP IV concentration and DPP4 genotyping was performed only for limited number of patients with HCV genotype 1 infection, since previous data had found that the association with SVR was found in HCV genotype 1, and this was a secondary objective. Further studies are warranted to assess the relation between sDPP IV concentration, DPP4 gene variants and treatment outcome in patients with CHC infection."
