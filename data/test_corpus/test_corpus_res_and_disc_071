"Patient Features and Histology
The baseline features of the 162 Sicilian (training set) and the 267 Northern Italian (validation set) patients are shown in Table 1. Sicilian patients were younger, comprised a larger prevalence of females and of subjects with metabolic alterations (obesity and diabetes), and had higher ALT serum levels compared to Northern Italian patients.

Data are given as mean ± standard deviation, median {interquartile range}, or as number of cases (%).*Histological data are available for all Sicilian patients, and for 126 Northern Italy patients.
Comparing Sicilian patients with the Northern Italian cases with liver biopsy, we have found a more severe spectrum of liver disease, i.e. more severe steatosis, lobular inflammation, fibrosis and obviously a higher prevalence of NASH, but a lower prevalence of hyperferritinemia.
The genetic frequency of the polymorphisms tested in Sicilian and Northern Italian cohorts are reported in Table 1. Specifically, PNPLA3 rs738409 GG genotype was present in 34 (21%) of Sicilian, compared to 33 (13%) of Northern Italy patients (p = 0.02). Genetic frequencies of the five polymorphisms tested in the Sicilian cohort fit with the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (χ2 = 1.08 for IL28B rs12979860, χ2 = 0.10 for PNPLA3 rs738409; χ2 = 0.35 for GCKR rs780094; χ2 = 0.71 for LYPLAL1 rs12137855; χ2 = 0.22 for NCAN rs2228603; p>0.05 for all), as well as genetic frequency of PNPLA3 SNP tested in the Northern Italy cohort (χ2 = 0, p>0.05). Factors Associated with Carotid Atherosclerosis
The prevalence of carotid plaques was similar in Sicilian and Northern Italian patients (36% vs. 31%; p = 0.29), as well as that of carotid thickening (35% vs. 34% p = 0.83), and mean maximum IMT (0.85±0.24 mm vs. 0.86±0.23 mm; p = 0.66). No study participants had clinically relevant carotid stenosis (i.e., ≥60%).
In the Sicilian cohort the prevalence of carotid plaques and carotid thickening was higher in patients with PNPLA3 GG compared to those with CC and CG genotype (523% vs. 32%, p = 0.02; and 62% vs. 28%, p<0.001, respectively) (Figure 1A and 1B). The association was only observed in patients younger than 50 (40% vs. 11%, p = 0.005 for carotid plaques; and 53% vs. 14%, p = 0.001 for IMT thickening), but not in those older than50 years (63% vs. 60%, p = 0.75 for carotid plaques; and 68% vs. 47%, p = 0.11 for IMT thickening) (Figure 1A and 1B). At multivariate logistic regression analyses, PNPLA3 GG genotype remained independently associated with the above quoted features (OR 2.94; 95% C.I. 1.12–7.70, p = 0.02 for carotid plaques, and OR 3.86; 95% C.I. 1.62–9.15, p = 0.002 for carotid thickening), together with age≥50 years (OR 5.39; 95%C.I. 2.14–13.5, p<0.001) and diabetes (OR 5.29; 95% C.I. 1.51–18.5, p = 0.009) for carotid plaques (Table 2), and with age ≥50 years (OR 4.25; 95%C.I. 1.88–9.62, p = 0.001) and LDL (OR 1.01; 95%C.I. 1.00–1.02, p = 0.007) for carotid thickening (Table 3). After Bonferroni correction, the link between PNPLA3 GG genotype and carotid alterations, was maintained for carotid thickening (p = 0.01), but not for carotid plaques (p = 0.10). Interestingly, no association was found between carotid alterations and both adiponectin serum levels (6.2±2.1 vs. 5.9±2.2, p = 0.41 for absence/presence of carotid plaques; 6.1±2.0 vs. 6.0±2.3, p = 0.78 for absence/presence of carotid thickening), serum ferritin (258±184 vs. 298±361, p = 0.44 for absence/presence of carotid plaques; 245±200 vs. 335±364, ng/ml, p = 0.11 for absence/presence of carotid thickening), and the other studied SNPs (Table S1).

Among histological features, both moderate-severe lobular inflammation and severe fibrosis were associated with the presence of carotid plaques even if this link was not maintained at multivariate analysis (Table 2). When considering separately patients <50 and ≥50 years, PNPLA3 GG genotype remained independently linked to both carotid plaques (OR 5.00, 95%C.I. 1.24–20.1; p = 0.02) (Table S2) and carotid thickening (OR 7.46, 95%C.I. 1.96–28.3; p = 0.003) (Table 3) in patients younger 50 years only.
In the validation cohort from Northern Italy, the prevalence of carotid plaques and carotid thickening was not significantly different according to the presence/absence of PNPLA3 GG genotype (24% vs. 33%, p = 0.32; and 30% vs. 34%, p = 0.69, respectively), but a significant difference was observed for carotid thickening in patients younger than 50 years (26% vs. 8%, p = 0.04) (Figure 1A and 1B). When the PNPLA3 GG genotype was forced into the carotid plaque model, the polymorphism was not associated with carotid plaques, while an independent association was observed for age ≥50 years (OR 7.91, 95%C.I. 3.72–18.3, p<0.001), ferritin (OR 1.96, 95%C.I. 1.41–2.83, p<0.001), and arterial hypertension (OR 2.08, 95%C.I. 1.11–3.89, p = 0.02) (Table 2). By contrast, when the PNPLA3 GG genotype and its term of interaction with age was forced into the carotid thickening model, the interaction term (p = 0.02) resulted independently associated with carotid thickening together with age≥50 years (OR 6.43, 95% C.I. 3.23–13.6, p = <0.001) and LDL (OR 1.01, 95% C.I. 1.00–1.02, p = 0.04) (Table 3). Accordingly, considering separately patients <50 and ≥50 years, PNPLA3 GG genotype remained independently associated with carotid thickening in patients younger than 50 years (OR 6.00, 95% C.I. 1.36–29, p = 0.01), but not in their older counterpart (OR 0.54, 95% C.I. 0.15–1.78, p = 0.35) (Table 3).
In the analysis using IMT as a continuous variable, Sicilian patients with PNPLA3 CC/CG genotype had a lower mean maximum IMT than their counterpart with PNPLA3 GG genotype (0.82±0.23 vs. 0.94±0.25, p = 0.01). Again, this difference is significant in patients younger than 50 years (0.75±0.17 vs. 0.85±0.25, p = 0.05), not in those older (0.93±0.25 vs. 1.00±0.26, p = 0.32) (Figure 1C). Older age (p = 0.001), higher LDL cholesterol (p = 0.04) and PNPLA3 GG genotype (p = 0.03) were independent factors associated with high IMT at multiple linear regression analysis. The link between PNPLA3 GG genotype and higher IMT was not maintained after Bonferroni correction (p = 0.15). No association was found in this cohort between IMT and adiponectin, ferritin serum levels, the other studied SNP, and histological features (p>0.10). In Northern Italian patients mean maximum IMT values were similar in patients with and without PNPLA3 GG genotype (0.85±0.21 in GG vs. 0.87±0.24 in CC/CG p = 0.87), even if a weak trend was observed in patients <50 years (0.79±0.21 in GG vs. 0.72±0.19 in CC/CG, p = 0.19) (Figure 1C). When PNPLA3 genotype was forced in the model, it was not significantly associated with higher IMT (p = 0.32), but IMT was independently linked to older age (p<0.001) and higher LDL serum levels (p<0.001).
A subgroup of 63 Northern Italy patients underwent ultrasonographic follow-up of carotid assessment. At the baseline, they were characterized by a slightly younger age (age >50, 19/63 = 46% vs. 125/204 = 61% of the rest of the cohort; p = 0.04), and by a lower prevalence of altered iron metabolism (hyperferritinemia, 17/63 = 27% vs. 104/204 = 51%; p<0.001), but with similar sex distribution, BMI, lipid levels, smoking status, liver enzymes and prevalence of NASH, basal IMT thickness and prevalence of plaques (p>0.5 for all). In this cohort, PNPLA3 GG was at risk for IMT progression (Figure 2) compared to CG and CC genotypes (p = 0.02). In particular PNPLA3 GG genotype (p = 0.05), together with age>50 years (p = 0.03) was independently associated with IMT progression by multivariate linear regression analysis (Table 4).

Of note, this feature was validated in an independent cohort of Northern Italian NAFLD patients, where PNPLA3 GG genotype was also associated with atherosclerosis progression.Different lines of evidence, including cross sectional and prospective studies, showed that NAFLD patients are at high risk of cardiovascular dysfunction/events, identifying conventional cardiometabolic alterations and the severity of liver damage as risk factors.[2]–[14] To the best of our knowledge this is first study assessing carotid atherosclerosis as a function of gene variants at risk for NAFLD. The novel finding, limited to a cohort of biopsy-proven Sicilian NAFLD patients, is the independent association between the presence of carotid plaques or larger IMT and PNPLA3 GG genotype. Of note this link was maintained after adjustment for well-known cardiovascular risk factors, including lipid levels and IR - not associated in our cohort to PNPLA3 genotype (data not shown) - and histological features of NAFLD.In particular we found that only 10% of patients <50 years carrying the PNPLA3 CC/CG genotype had carotid plaques, compared with 40% in the group carrying the PNPLA3 GG genotype. This figure is close to the value observed in the subgroup of patients ≥50 years (again, about 60%), irrespective of the PNPLA3 genotype. These data were also confirmed when considering IMT≥1 mm, and high maximum IMT instead of carotid plaques. Interestingly, in the validation cohort of Northern Italian NAFLD patients, vascular alterations were also not different according to PNPLA3 genotype in the total population, but in patients younger than 50 a link between atherosclerosis and PNPLA3 GG genotype was again observed, and maintained after correction for well known risk factors. The weaker association between PNPLA3 genotype and carotid atherosclerosis in Northern Italian, compared to Sicilian patients, could be expression of the lower prevalence of PNPLA3 GG genotype, metabolic dysfunctions and severity of liver disease observed in the validation cohort. In any case, results from both populations are finally consonant, and data from the Northern Italy NAFLD also demonstrated an independent association between PNPLA3 GG genotype and IMT progression over time in a subgroup of patients characterized by young age at presentation.Although this study was merely observational and not designed to explore the reasons for the association of atherosclerosis markers with PNPLA3 genotype, some hypotheses can be proposed. A recent study by Valenti and colleagues showed that PNPLA3 variant was directly related to hepatic apoptosis in NAFLD. [15] According to these data, it is plausible to hypothesize that PNPLA3 genotype, by regulating apoptotic activity - a finding also involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis [27] -, might modulate vascular damage. PNPLA3 gene variants in individual patients might increase lipid storage in the arterial vessels, similar to that observed in the liver, and could also induce release of ICAM-1, an endothelium-derived inflammatory marker that has been associated with myocardial infarction and stroke. [28] Finally, considering that the mechanisms linking the severity of NAFLD to the PNPLA3 genotype are largely unknown, we might also hypothesize that the same pathway generating liver disease might also produce vascular damage.The association of PNPLA3 GG genotype with atherosclerosis limited to younger patients is intriguing. A possible hypothesis would be that in younger patients, where the role of aging and classic atherosclerosis risk factors are weaker, PNPLA3 can fully exert its atherogenic role; in older patients, as effect of PNPLA3-induced liver disease progression, the reduction of LDL levels (115.1±38.6 mg/dl in F3–F4 vs. 128.9±38.2 mg/dl in F0–F2 Sicilian cohort) [29] and arterial pressure values associated with advanced liver disease might counterbalance the potential atherogenic role of the PNPLA3 genotype, vanishing the differences in IMT of the different polymorphisms.We confirmed that type 2 diabetes and higher LDL cholesterol levels in the Sicilian cohort, as well as arterial hypertension, higher LDL cholesterol and ferritin levels in the Northern Italian cohort, were all independent risk factors for carotid atherosclerosis. Interestingly, in the Sicilian population, even if not maintained at multivariate analysis, we also observed an association between carotid plaques and the severity of both liver lobular inflammation and fibrosis, as also reported by Targher et al. [11] Due to the very high prevalence of NASH in the Sicilian cohort, we cannot evaluate the potential association between atherosclerosis and the diagnosis of NASH. Finally, in the test cohort, we did not find any association between carotid atherosclerosis and other SNP promoting NAFLD and its severity. Accordingly GCKR, LYPLAL, NCAN and IL28B gene variants might exert their pathogenic effect mainly in the liver, without (in)directly affecting vascular endothelium.From a clinical point of view, our data confirm that NAFLD patients are at high risk of carotid atherosclerosis, especially in the presence of classical risk factors, in younger patients with PNPLA3 GG genotype, and in patients aged 50 or more. The lack of association between PNPLA3 GG genotype and atherosclerosis in older patients, together with the selection of a population at high cardiovascular risk (i.e. NAFLD/NASH), could explain why the I148M PNPLA3 gene variant was not identified as a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases/events in GWAS studies, [30], [31] other than a recent report observing a link between ICAM-1 serum levels and PNPLA3 genotype in a large cohort of healthy women. Accordingly, the clinical significance of our data need to be assessed with caution. Further prospective large scale studies, assessing separately younger and older patients are needed to clarify the effect on cardiovascular outcomes, and the importance of a more intensive diagnostic workload and follow-up to prevent cardiovascular complications in selected NAFLD groups according to PNPLA3 genotype.The main limitation of this study lies in its cross-sectional nature, unable to identify pathogenic mechanisms(s) linking PNPLA3 genotype and carotid atherosclerosis, and in the relative low number of patients younger 50 years. A further methodological question is the potentially limited external validity of the results caused by the small sample of patients especially when considering subgroup analyses according to age. Our study included two cohorts of Italian NAFLD patients, largely overweight-obese, who may be different, in terms of both metabolic features and severity of liver disease, from the majority of prevalent cases of NAFLD in the general population. The lack of data on a control Sicilian population might further limit the strength of our results; however considering the data published from our group, [32] we can observe that our NAFLD population had similar mean IMT and a higher prevalence of carotid plaques, compared to an older control population, [32] and a higher prevalence of PNLA3 GG genotype compared to a cohort of 258 Sicilian CHC patients followed at our center (21%vs 9%) (unpublished data). Obviously, only a case control study could assess if the higher prevalence of carotid atherosclerosis observed in NAFLD [2] compared to individuals without steatosis, is related to an higher prevalence of PNPLA3 genotype and risk of cardiovascular disease. Finally, we also need data on serum levels and liver expression of markers of dysmetabolic function and proinflammatory cytokines potentially involved in the cardiovascular alterations of NAFLD patients.In conclusion, in two cohorts of Sicilian and Northern Italian NAFLD patients, we showed that PNPLA3 GG genotype is associated with a high risk of carotid atherosclerosis in patients younger than 50. Mechanisms underlying this association, and whether PNPLA3 genotype also influences cardiovascular events need to be further investigated."
