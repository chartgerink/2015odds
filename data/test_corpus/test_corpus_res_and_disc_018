"A strong association was noted between IL28B genotype and pretreatment normalized ALT (median 2.4, 2.3, and 1.6 for CC, CT, and TT respectively) and as well as APRI, a biomarker of liver fibrosis [23], (median 0.7, 0.6, and 0.5 for CC, CT, and TT respectively) among HCV genotype 3 infected patients, with homozygous TT carriers having the lowest levels (p<0.0001 and p = 0.001 respectively, Kruskal-Wallis test; Figure 1). With regards to ALT, CT carriers were more similar to CC than TT (CC vs. CT p = 0.6, CT vs. TT p = 0.0001, and CC vs. TT p<0.0001, Mann-Whitney U-test), but when evaluating APRI, CT patients were intermediary (CC vs. CT p = 0.03, CT vs. TT p = 0.07, and CC vs. TT p = 0.0015, Mann-Whitney U-test). This was mirrored by a significantly higher proportion of these patients having lower portal inflammation grades in their pretreatment liver biopsies, in contrast to homozygous CC carriers who had the highest grades (p = 0.02, Chi-squared test; Figure 2C). A similar non-significant trend was noted for interface hepatitis grade and fibrosis stage, with CC carriers having the highest grades and stages. No such trend was noted for the grade of lobular inflammation or confluent necrosis. In accordance with the observation for portal inflammation, homozygous CC carriers had the most pronounced steatosis and homozygous TT carriers had the least (p = 0.03, Chi squared test; Figure 2D). Because APRI is a continuous variable in contrast to fibrosis stage, which is ordered categorical data derived from liver biopsies prone to sampling error, different statistical methods are applicable, which may explain the significant association between IL28B genotype and APRI for genotype 3 in contrast to a non-significant trend for fibrosis stage. 10.1371/journal.pone.0029370.g001 Figure 1 Impact of IL28B (rs12979860) on normalized ALT and AST to platelet ratio index (APRI) among HCV genotype 2 and 3 infected patients.

Histogram displaying the proportion of patients, and p-value obtained using Chi-squared test. The associations between IL28B genotype and ALT, APRI, portal inflammation grade, and steatosis observed among HCV genotype 3 infected patients, were not significant among HCV genotype 2 infected patients nor were any such trends noted among these latter patients. It should, however, be noted that the HCV genotype 2 infected patients enrolled in the present study were significantly older than those infected with HCV genotype 3 (mean age 47.2 vs. 39.8 years for HCV genotype 2 and 3 respectively, P<0.0001, Mann-Whitney U-test), and the number of patients enrolled with HCV genotype 2 was smaller than genotype 3 (98 vs. 241).The HCV genotype 3 infected homozygous CC carriers had significantly higher baseline viral load (mean 6.3, 5.9, and 5.9 log10 IU/mL for CC, CT, and TT respectively, p<0.0001, Kruskal-Wallis test; Figure 3C) as well as first phase decline as measured by the decline in HCV RNA during the first three days of interferon/ribavirin therapy (mean 2.1, 1.7, and 1.9 log10 IU/mL for CC, CT, and TT respectively, p = 0.0005, Kruskal-Wallis test; Figure 3D). In contrast, no such associations were noted among HCV genotype 2 infected patients. Additionally no significant associations were noted among IL28B genotype and the likelihood of achieving SVR irrespective of HCV genotype. Further details regarding the impact of IL28B genotype on the viral kinetic during therapy in this trial are provided elsewhere [24]. 10.1371/journal.pone.0029370.g003 Figure 3 Impact of IL28B (rs12979860) on baseline viral load and decline in mean HCV RNA day 0–3 among HCV genotype 2 and 3 infected patients. Box plots displaying the 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 90th percentiles, and p-values obtained using Kruskal-Wallis test. Lower baseline HCV RNA levels were significantly associated with lower portal inflammation (p = 0.01, Chi-squared test) and steatosis grades (p<0.0001, Chi-squared test). Subgroup analyses revealed that these associations were significant for genotype 3 (p = 0.003 for portal inflammation and P<0.0001 for steatosis, Chi-squared test; Figure 4C and D respectively), but not for HCV genotype 2. These associations remained significant when controlling for IL28B genotype. 10.1371/journal.pone.0029370.g004 Figure 4 Association between baseline viral load and portal inflammation as well as steatosis among HCV genotype 2 and 3 infected patients. Box plots displaying the 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 90th percentiles, and p-values obtained using Kruskal-Wallis test. In spite of the beneficial treatment effects among patients carrying the C allele carriage at rs12979860, little is known regarding its impact on the natural history of chronic HCV. Abe et al. reported that among Japanese patients infected with HCV genotype 1 or 2, patients with homozygous carriage of the IL28B major allele had significantly higher inflammatory activity and higher fibrosis stage, indicating that this SNP genotype may not be beneficial outside the context of therapeutic intervention [18]. Similarly in a treatment trial by Moghaddam et al. involving HCV genotype 3 infected Caucasian patients, CC carriers at rs12979860 had significantly higher normalized ALT levels and APRI scores than CT or TT carriers, however, liver biopsy evaluations were not reported [19]. In this context the main finding of the present study was a significant association between CC carriage at rs12979860 and ALT, APRI score, portal inflammation grade, and steatosis among HCV genotype 3 infected patients, and that these associations appeared to be secondary to a significantly higher baseline viral load. Indeed it has previously been reported that among HCV genotype 3 infected patients, steatosis is more prevalent and pronounced than in other HCV genotypes [22], [25] due to impaired lipid export from infected hepatocytes [26], [27] possibly mediated by inhibition of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) [28], [29] or due to increased availability of free fatty acids by reduced oxidation or by increased de novo synthesis [30], [31], [32], [33] of the genotype 3 core protein. Additionally the presence of steatosis in HCV genotype 3 infection is associated with higher baseline HCV RNA levels [25], [34], negatively impacts the clearance of HCV RNA during the initial 12 weeks of therapy [34], and entails accelerated fibrosis progression [22] indicative of a likely cytopathic effect of HCV genotype 3 virus. Moreover, it was recently reported that the cumulative mortality of HCV genotype 3 infected US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) patients failing to achieve SVR after therapy was higher than among non-SVR patients infected with genotypes 1 or 2 [35] possibly secondary to HCV genotype 3 associated steatosis and ensuing liver damage.In the setting of therapeutic intervention for HCV genotype 2 or 3, uncertainty prevails regarding the benefit of favorable IL28B allele carriage. Sarrazin et al. reported increased SVR rates following therapy among HCV genotype 2 or 3 infected Caucasian CC rs12979860 carriers as compared to carriers of the T allele [36]. In contrast Mangia et al. noted an association between IL28B genotype and SVR only among HCV genotype 2 or 3 infected patients failing to achieve RVR [37]. Yu et al. reported a significantly higher rate of achieving RVR but not SVR among Asian homozygous TT rs8099917 carriers infected with HCV genotype 2 [38] and Moghaddam et al. noted similar results among HCV genotype 3 infected Caucasian CC rs12979860 carriers [19]. In the present study a significantly improved first phase decline in HCV RNA was noted among homozygous CC carriers infected with HCV genotype 3 but not among genotype 2. However, the higher baseline viral load among these genotype 3 infected patients essentially negated most of the favorable decline in HCV RNA observed during the initial three days of therapy. The reason for failing to observing an association between CCrs12979860 and the first phase decline in HCV RNA among the HCV genotype 2 infected patients enrolled in the present study is not clear, but may indicate that IL28B SNP polymorphisms have a more pronounced therapeutic impact among HCV genotype 3 than genotype 2 infected Caucasian patients of Scandinavian descent.In conclusion, the present study demonstrated an association between CC carriage at rs12979860 and ALT, APRI, portal inflammation grade, and steatosis among HCV genotype 3 infected patients, and that this association may be secondary to the significantly higher baseline viral load. In this light, analysis of IL28B genotype may be beneficial among HCV genotype 3 infected patients so as to encourage homozygous CC rs12979860 carriers to initiate therapy. Additionally the finding that IL28B variability did not impact on liver histopathology or viral load among genotype 2 infected patients implies that IL28B may differentially regulate the course of genotype 2 and 3 infection."
