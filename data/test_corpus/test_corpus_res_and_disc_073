"Basal Expression of BLVRA in PBL of HCV Patients BLVRA expression in PBL was markedly increased in HCV-infected patients before antiviral treatment, when compared to the control group (1.68±0.68 vs. 1.28±0.36, respectively, p<0.001). Simultaneously, baseline mRNA levels of BLVRA were significantly higher only in patients who achieved SVR, compared to the control group (1.87±0.74 vs. 1.28±0.36, respectively, p<0.001), but not in non-SVR patients (1.32±0.34 vs. 1.28±0.36 p = 0.65). The BLVRA expression in PBL of relapse patients (n = 5) before antiviral treatment was substantially reduced compared to SVR patients (1.15±0.19 vs. 1.87±0.74, p<0.001), and was also decreased, although non-significantly, when compared to non-SVR patients (n = 15) (1.15±0.19 vs. 1.32±0.34, p = 0.09). Significant differences in basal BLVRA expression were found between SVR and non-SVR patients (Table 1). When assessing possible factors responsible for treatment response, only BLVRA expression has been found to be a strong predictor (Table 3). Exclusion of BLVRA from multivariant analysis did not have any effect on predictive value of tested variables. Based on ROC analysis (Figure 2), BLVRA expression predicted the treatment response with 76% sensitivity, 70% specificity (positive predictive value = 83%, negative predictive value = 61%). Since ribavirin treatment is commonly associated with hemolysis, and bilirubin overproduction might upregulate BLVRA, we assessed the relationship between ribavirin-induced drop of hemoglobin levels and BLVRA expression (Table 4.). However, no changes in BLVRA expression were detected either in 12 or 24 weeks of antiviral therapy in hemoglobin depleted patients. 10.1371/journal.pone.0057555.g002 Figure 2 ROC curve of BLVRA expression in peripheral blood leukocytes of HCV infected patients.

Expression of BLVRA in PBL in HCV Patients during Antiviral Treatment BLVRA expression significantly increased at weeks 12 (2.57±1.61, p = 0.0004), 24 (2.57±1.17, p = 0.0002), and 36 (2.16±1.19, p = 0.03) after initiation of standard antiviral therapy when compared to the initial levels (1.68±0.68). Significant differences in BLVRA mRNA levels between SVR and non-SVR patients were found at weeks 12 and 48 after treatment initiation. Similar trends were also observed at weeks 24 and 36. These differences, however, did not reached statistical significance, most likely due to the low number of subjects (Figure.3). Interestingly, BLVRA expression in SVR patients after withdrawal of antiviral therapy (n = 10) decreased substantially compared to BLVRA expression levels at week 24 (median [IQ range] 1.38 [1.2–1.6] vs. 2.52 [1.5–2.8], p = 0.03), and reached control levels (median [IQ range] 1.38 [1.2–1.6] vs. 1.28 [1–1.5], p = 0.43). 10.1371/journal.pone.0057555.g003 Figure 3 BLVRA expression in peripheral blood leukocytes of responders and non-SVR patients during standard antiviral therapy.

Expression and Activity of HMOX in HCV Patients Compared to controls, the HMOX activity in PBMC of HCV-infected patients before antiviral treatment was substantially reduced (20.6±16.3 vs 36.3±18.1 pmol CO/106 cells/h, respectively, p = 0.001). Although PBL gene expression of HMOX1 did not differ between HCV-infected patients and the control group, the HMOX2 expression was slightly, but significantly, reduced in patients with HCV infection (4.30±1.13 vs 4.98±0.94, respectively, p = 0.001). While a significant correlation between PBL gene expression of HMOX1, HMOX2 mRNA and HMOX activity in PBMC was only detected in control samples (r2 = 0.210, p = 0.007; r2 = 0.113, p = 0.03), this relationship was not observed in the HCV-infected patients (r2 = 0.040, p = 0.20; r2 = 0.046, p = 0.33). Finally, no differences in either HMOX activity or HMOX expression between SVR and non-SVR patients were detected. Correlation between BLVRA and HMOX mRNA Levels in the Liver and PBL, and HCV RNA in PBL and Liver Tissue No significant differences in pretreatment expression of BLVRA in the liver were found between SVR (n = 18) and non-SVR patients (n = 4) (0.35±0.24 vs. 0.34±0.24 p = 0.97) most likely because of high variability of BLVRA expression in the liver compared to PBL. BLVRA expression, but not that of HMOX1/HMOX2, in the liver and PBL of HCV-infected patients were in direct relationship (n = 13, r2 = 0.347, p = 0.03). No correlation was found between the mRNA levels of HMOX1/HMOX2/BLVRA and HCV RNA in the liver and PBL. Because of the side effects and high costs of current antiviral therapy, it is very important to identify those markers that can discriminate among those patients who will respond to the standard treatment. The precise molecular mechanisms underlying the responsiveness to antiviral treatment among HCV-infected individuals have yet to be completely identified.Enzymes of the heme catabolic pathway seem to belong to such promising markers. In fact, Zhu and coworkers [32] recently provided a plausible mechanism for the antiviral activity of HMOX1, demonstrating that the direct product of its activity, biliverdin, potently inhibits viral replication at biologically relevant concentrations in human hepatoma Huh-7.5 cells replicating HCV RNA, most likely via inhibition of HCV NS3/4A protease. In the current study, we prospectively investigated HMOX activity, as well as HMOX1 expression in HCV-infected patients. Surprisingly, no difference in mRNA expression of HMOX1 in PBL was found between therapeutically naïve HCV patients and controls, although the total HMOX activity in PBMC was significantly decreased in HCV patients before treatment, compared to the control group.Furthermore, a correlation between the expression of HMOX1, HMOX2, and total HMOX activity was only detected in the control samples; not in the HCV-infected patients. In fact, interference of HCV with HMOX1 induction [33], reduced hepatic expression of HMOX1 both in vitro and in vivo in HCV infection [8]; additionally, induced hepatic HMOX1 expression in vitro were reported [17]. We hypothesized that HMOX and BLVRA gene expression in PBL can reflect their expression in the liver. In our study, due to unavailability of liver specimens of control subjects, correlation between the liver and PBL could be analyzed only in HCV patients. No association of HMOX1/HMOX2 expression was found between the liver and PBL, and HMOX1/HMOX2/BLVRA and HCV RNA in the liver and PBL. On the other hand, expression of BLVRA in the liver tissue correlated with expression of BLVRA in PBL. The expression of BLVRA in PBL was higher in HCV-infected patients before antiviral therapy, compared to the control group; and subsequently increased 12, 24, and 36 weeks after initiation of standard antiviral therapy, when compared to initial levels. Most importantly, BLVRA expression in PBL was found to be strongly associated with response to the antiviral treatment. Recent genome-wide association studies identified strong evidence IL28B gene variation (rs12979860) with SVR rates in patients chronically infected with genotype 1 HCV [34], [35], [36]. Although not statistically significant, a similar trend was observed in our cohort of patients for all genotypes (p = 0.11) as well as for genotype 1 (p = 0.16). The prevalence of CC vs non CC genotypes in our group of patients corresponds to prevalence rates of chronically infected HCV patients in the Czech Republic reported recently [37]. However, it should be noted that the lack of association with other clinically important variables tested in our regression model including IL28B gene variation might be due to small sample size effect. Furthermore, there was a clear trend for association of upregulated baseline BLVRA expression in PBL of patients with favorable CC genotype as compared to both non CC (p = 0.059) and TT IL28B (p = 0.058) patients.Induced BLVRA gene transcription in PBMC of uninfected chimpanzees in response to INF-α [38] and in INF-α treated PBMC [39] were previously reported. In accord with this data, BLVRA overexpression in our HCV-infected patients prior to and during antiviral treatment seems to be due to BVLRA upregulation by INF-α. Moreover, our results showing an association of BLVRA in PBL with the treatment outcome are in agreement with substantially greater global induction of IFN-stimulated genes observed in the PBMC of treatment responders [40].This data is in accord with our observation indicating that 1) SVR patients have increased BLVRA expression prior initiation of therapy (likely due to endogenous interferon induced by HCV infection); 2) both SVR and non-SVR patients have increased BLVRA expression during antiviral therapy (likely due to exogenous interferon administered therapeutically); 3) SVR patients after withdrawal of antiviral therapy have decreased expression of BLVRA to control values (likely due to decreased production of endogenous interferon, since HCV, as the major stimulus, is absent). It is also important to note, that BLVRA expression during HCV infection and antiviral therapy is independent of ribavirin-induced hemolysis. However, our data does not provide conclusive evidence whether BLVRA expression is involved actively in driving the treatment response, or is just a surrogate marker for treatment responsiveness.In conclusion, our pilot results demonstrate that patients with chronic HCV infection significantly upregulate BLVRA expression in PBL, closely correlating with those in liver tissue. In addition, basal BLVRA expression in PBL is strongly associated with response to treatment. Finally, the lack of BLVRA overexpression is associated with non-responsiveness to standard antiviral therapy. Nevertheless, larger prospective studies are needed to confirm our data."
