"The expression of an IFN-response gene signature in liver biopsies
Total RNA was extracted from curls cut from FFPE liver biopsies collected from patients prior to the initiation of therapy, and assayed on a Nanostring nCounter for expression of an IFN gene signature that we designed based on our own microarray results, databases of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), and regulatory elements in gene promoter regions. The expression of these genes was then normalized to the expression of four housekeeping genes (Actin B, GAPDH, GUSB and PGK1) that was included in the Nanostring analysis. As shown in Table 1 there was a large sample-to-sample variation in the expression of the genes in the IFN signature. Some genes were expressed at low but detectable levels such as cytokine and growth factors, including ANGPT2, IFNB1, IL6 and VEGFC, as well as classical IFN-stimulated genes such as Mx1, SOCS1 and TLR3. In addition a number of genes critical in the IFN response pathway, which included GBP1, MAVS, TNFSF10 (TRAIL), and XAF1, were expressed at relatively high levels in liver biopsies. These results are consistent with our previous finding that low levels of type I IFNs could be detected in the sera of patients chronically infected with HCV [22], as well as the findings that ISG expression could be detected in the livers of HCV-infected patients and in experimentally-infected chimpanzees [23]–[26]. The expression of a subset of the IFN gene signature correlates with the patient response to therapy
In the 130 liver samples subjected to Nanostring analysis, 43 were obtained from HCV-infected patients who responded to IFN-ribavirin therapy (responders), 56 from HCV-infected patients who did not respond to therapy (nonresponders), and 31 from patients who had an initial virological response to therapy, but then relapsed during therapy and had high viral HCV titers (relapsers). Of these 130 patient samples, 112 had their IL28B genotype determined (Table 3). The liver tissue was obtained from 80 African-American (AA) and 50 Caucasian hepatitis C-infected patients (Table 4). Consistent with the previous findings that African Americans demonstrate a lower response rate to IFN than Caucasians, in the African American group of patients 27.5% were classified as responders, 57.5% as non-responders and 15% as relapsers. In contrast, in the Caucasian group of patients 50% were classified as responders, 22.1% as non-responders and 27.9% as relapsers. Initial analysis of differences in gene expression between responders and non-responders (excluding relapsers) revealed statistically significant differences (p<0.05) in the expression of 16 out of the 39 genes examined, which included CCL5, DDX58/RIG-I, DHX58/LGP2, EIF2AK2, IFI6, IFI16, IFIH1/MDA5, IRF7, ISG20, MX1, OAS1, PLSCR1, RSAD2, STAT1, TLR3 and XAF1 (Figure 1). Most interestingly, these genes were expressed at higher levels in liver biopsies from patients that did not respond to IFN-ribavirin therapy as compared to the responders to therapy. The higher expression levels of ISGs prior to therapy in nonresponders compared with responders was consistent with several previous reports [27]–[30]. It is important to note that there was no relationship found between the expression of the IFNβ gene in liver biopsies, and responsiveness to exogenous IFN therapy. This finding is consistent with our previous report that serum levels of type I IFNs in patients chronically infected with HCV did not correlate with the response to exogenous IFN therapy [22].

Although there was no statistical difference between the various genes in nonresponders and relapsers, the expression of CASP4, GADD45G and IFI16 was found to be statistically different between the relapsers and the responders to IFN-ribavirin therapy. As shown in Figure 2, while CASP4 and IFI16 expression was higher in the group of relapsers, GADD45G expression was found to be somewhat lower. In addition, we compared the expression of the IFN gene signature according to race and found no statistical differences according to race, i.e. AA responders did not differ from Caucasian responders, etc.

To gain insights into the cellular functions of the genes that were found associated with IFN responsiveness, we performed signaling pathway analysis using the Ingenuity Pathway analysis (IPA) software. As shown in Figure 3, 4 and 5, several critical antiviral signaling pathways were overrepresented in the genes that are associated with IFN responsiveness, For example TLR3, RIG-I/DDX58, MDA5/IFIH1, PKR/EIF2AK2, OAS1, IRF7 and RANTES/CCL5 are expressed at higher levels in nonresponders and are components in the pattern recognition receptor (PRR) pathway that is involved in the recognition of bacteria and viruses (Figure 4). Of these, TLR3 is known to recognize dsRNA intermediates produced during HCV RNA replication [31], [32], while RIG-I senses 5′-triphosphate-bearing, genomic or antigenomic HCV RNAs [33]. Activation of either pathway in hepatocytes leads to an IFN response that restricts HCV replication. PKR has also been shown to recognize HCV RNA [34], although it is uncertain whether PKR has an antiviral and/or proviral effect [2]. OAS1 is a component of the OAS-RNase L system that had been shown to detect and degrade HCV RNA in HeLa cytoplasmic extracts [35]. In addition, RIG-I, LGP2, MDA5, IRF7 and STAT1 are also expressed at higher levels in nonresponders (Figure 5) and are components of the pathways leading to IRF activation by cytosolic PRRs or signaling to ISG induction downstream of the IFN receptors, which result in an innate immune response against viruses and bacteria. Furthermore, genes with significantly higher expression in nonresponders included two ISGs that possess anti-HCV activity in cell culture, i.e. RSAD2/viperin and ISG20 [24], [36].

AA in the present study had ∼three-fold higher inheritance of the homozygous TT genotype at the Il28B-associated rs12979860 SNP compared to homozygous CC (Table 3). In contrast, C had ∼four-fold higher inheritance of CC compared to TT. These results are consistent with the well-established racially associated difference in inheritance at rs12979860 in chronic HCV infection [11]–[14]. The inheritance of the CC versus TT or CT genotypes at rs12979860 was highly correlated with (OR = 3.17, 95% CI 1.004 – 9.989, p = 0.049) a sustained response of HCV-infected patients to IFN-ribavirin therapy (responders). In addition, failure to respond to therapy (nonresponders), or an initial virological response to therapy but then relapsed with high viral HCV titers (relapsers) was highly dependent upon rs12979860 genotype (p = 0.000972) and race (p = 0.00861). Although rs12979860 genotype and other il28B-associated SNPs in linkage disequilibrium may be the most important correlates for racially associated differences in response to IFN-ribavirin therapy for hepatitis C, factors not associated with the il28B locus also contribute to racially associated response differences. The development of a predictive model for the patient response to therapy based on the expression of IFN signature genes, and nucleotide polymorphism in the IL28B gene
Using logistic regression with cross validation, we found that the best model contained RSAD2, IFI6, IFI16, STAT1, CCL5, and XAF1. We show the results of the logistic regression models in Table 5. We note that not all variables were statistically significant in the final models. Although we used statistical significance to help develop candidate models, we selected the final model based on its predictive potential in the 10-fold cross validation procedure. Higher expression levels of RSAD2, IFI6, IFI16, and CCL5 were associated with a reduced probability of patient response to IFN. Lower expression of STAT1 and XAF1 were associated with increased probability of response. Interestingly, race was not strongly predictive of response when controlling for the effects of these genes, indicating that we may have identified some of the genetic factors that reduce response rates among African Americans. Our model accurately predicted response for 79.2% of individuals, with a specificity of 90% and sensitivity of 58% (See Figure 6). Therefore, although the model rarely predicted response when the true outcome was nonresponse/relapse (false positives), it lacked sensitivity with several false negatives. Model-based predictions were superior to race alone, which was not very predictive of response with only 60% overall accuracy.

IL28B status was available in 112 out of the 130 patients whose IFN-response gene signature was examined. In this subset of patients, our expression-based model using RSAD2, IFI6, IFI16, CCL5, XAF1, and STAT1 was 73.0% accurate. Although this was lower than accuracy for the cohort as a whole, it still performed better than other expression-based models. We found that we could improve performance by including IL28B status. Combining this with RSAD2, IFI6, IFI16, and CCL5 had 74.9% accuracy. Importantly, this model had improved accuracy over a model with IL28B and race alone (without expression data), which had an accuracy of 67.8%.
Approximately 3% of the world's population is infected with HCV, and ∼80% of HCV-infected individuals eventually become chronically infected. While long-term persistence results predominantly from evasion of the adaptive immune response to viral infection, evasion of host innate immune response is believed to contribute to establishing persistent HCV infection [6]. The IFN system is a key player in the innate immune response against viral infections, by inducing an antiviral state in the host against a variety of viral pathogens. Moreover, HCV is highly sensitive to treatment with type I and type III IFNs in vitro, and IFN remains a mainstay of treatment of HCV infected patients [37]. However, precisely why the current IFNα-based therapy is only effective in a proportion of treated patients remains largely a mystery, and this has been an area of intensive investigation. In the present study we compared expression of an IFN-response geneset in FFPE derived from liver biopsies from patients enrolled in an IFN-ribavirin trial conduced at UTHSC, which were taken before therapy was initiated. Our goal was to establish an IFN-response gene signature that can be used to predict IFN-responsiveness in hepatitis C patients.The IFN-response signature geneset was based on our own microarray studies on IFN-induced genes in human and mouse cell lines, a database of IFN-stimulated genes from a variety of cells, and regulatory elements of gene promoter regions. Our strategy was to focus on genes that may play an important role in the antiviral innate immune response, and that were induced by various IFN activated signaling pathways. Thus genes such as Mx1 and PKR/EIF2AK2 contain an ISRE (IFN-stimulated response element), and are induced by the classical IFN-activated signaling that involved JAK1 and TYK2 activation and STAT1 and STAT2 transcription factors [38]. However ISGs such as RIG-I/DDX58 and MDA5/IFIH1 may be induced through an NF-κB-dependent pathway as well [16]. In addition, a number of ISGs such as VISA/MAVS and Casp4 do not contain an ISRE but rather an SIE (c-sis-inducible element) and appear to be regulated by STAT1 and STAT3 homodimers and heterodimers [39]. In addition, some SIE-containing ISGs such as IRF1 and MYD88 may also be regulated through an NF-κB-dependent pathway [18]. All 39 members of the IFN-regulated signature gene set were induced upon IFNα treatment of Huh7 hepatoma cells (data not shown).We found that nearly all 39 of the IFN-response signature genes were expressed in liver biopsies from chronically HCV-infected patients enrolled in the clinical trial of IFN-ribavirin at UTHSC. Previous studies using microarrays to determine global gene expression of liver biopsies from chronically HCV-infected patients and from experimentally HCV-infected chimpanzees show elevated ISG expression [23]–[26]. In addition, there was a great deal of heterogeneity in the expression level of the signature genes in the different patients. For example, genes that were expressed at relatively low levels such as IFNβ, IL6, TNFRSF10B, VEGFC and ANGPT2 were expressed only in a subset of patient samples. In contrast, genes that were expressed at relatively high levels such as TNFSF10 (TRAIL), OAS1, RANTES (CCL5) and IRF9 were detected in all liver biopsies. It is of particular interest that only a small fraction of liver biopsies (∼10%) from patients chronically infected with HCV expressed the IFNβ gene. While this seems to conflict with our previous finding that ∼50% of the serum samples from a smaller patient population in the clinical trial of IFN-ribavirin had detectable levels of type I IFN [22], it is conceivable that most of the circulating levels of type I IFN derive from extrahepatic sources such as the plasmacytoid dendritic cells. Consistent with our data, two recent studies have shown that type III IFNs rather than type I IFNs are induced in the liver of experimentally HCV-infected chimpanzees and that the intrahepatic level of type III IFNs correlates with that of ISG expression [40], [41]. Our IFN-response geneset did not contain type III IFN genes, since when this study was initiated and the geneset was constructed a role for IL29/IL28B in hepatic innate immunity to HCV infection was not recognized. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that intrahepatic type III IFN level was not found to associate with the outcome of acute HCV infection [40], nor was it related to response to IFN therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis C [42].Another important finding from these studies is that expression of a subset of these genes in liver biopsies inversely correlated with the responsiveness to IFN-ribavirin therapy, i.e. higher expression was observed in nonresponders as compared to responders. Although this finding is counterintuitive, as one would expect an active IFN system would help eliminate the virus during therapy, it is supported by a number of studies, which have shown that patients with a high ISG expression prior to the initiation of IFN therapy seem to respond poorly to IFN therapy [27]–[30]. Additional support is lent from a study showing that the expression of intrahepatic ISGs was already maximally induced in chimpanzees chronically infected with HCV. Consequently, when exogenous IFN was administered, there was no further ISG upregulation [43]. Although the underlying mechanism remains elusive, nonresponder hepatitis C patients tend to have pre-activated Jak-STAT pathway prior to therapy, which may connect to IFN refractoriness [27].However, it is important to note that in our study only a subset of the IFN-regulated genes examined were expressed at a statistically significant higher level in patients that were nonresponsive to IFN therapy. Of particular interest, some of these overexpressed genes were either involved in viral sensing (TLR3, RIG-I/DDX58, DHX58/LGP2, MDA5) or effector functions of IFNs (ISG20, RSAD2, PKR, etc.). Both TLR3 and RIG-I can sense HCV RNA (although they recognize different viral ligand forms) early after infection and initiate signaling pathways culminating in the induction of an IFN response that curtails HCV replication [32], [33]. However, HCV has evolved to disarm both mechanisms by NS3/4A-mediated cleavage of the essential adaptor proteins, TRIF (Toll/interleukin receptor domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon), and MAVS, once the infection is established in hepatocytes [44]–[46]. Among the ISG effectors, ISG20 and RSAD2 have been shown to inhibit HCV replication, while controversial results have been reported for PKR [2]. There are several possibilities that may explain why induction of the endogenous anti-viral ISGs prior to IFN therapy fails to contain HCV infection [47]. The anti-HCV ISGs may only be transcriptionally upregulated in uninfected surrounding cells but not in HCV-infected hepatocytes. Alternatively, ISG transcripts may be made in both infected and uninfected cells but ISG proteins are only made in uninfected cells because of PKR activation in infected cells [48]. Third, some HCV proteins may inhibit the effector functions of the antiviral ISGs. Regardless of the infection/treatment outcome, the induction of a subset of IFN-regulated signature genes we identified in treatment-naïve patient liver underscores the important roles these genes/pathways may play in host attempts to control HCV infection in the liver.In addition, we found CCL5/RANTES to be over-expressed in both nonresponders and relapsers to IFN therapy. CCL5 is a chemokine produced by monocyte/macrophage subsets in the liver, which contributes to recruiting T cells and other leukocytes to the infection site and also to the progression and resolution of liver fibrosis [49]. A recent study from our group suggests that infected hepatocytes represent a cellular source for CCL5 production at early phase of HCV infection, through TLR3-mediated sensing of HCV dsRNA intermediates and subsequent activation of NF-κB, a transcription factor pivotal for RANTES synthesis [31]. CCL5 is associated with a Th1 lymphocyte-related cytokine/chemokine profile and HCV clearance [50]. However, CCL5 may also shape the IFN response in the liver by altering the infiltration and activation of hepatic stellate cells, which maintains chronic HCV infection in the liver in part by inhibiting liver fibrosis [51]. Exactly how pre-activated intrahepatic RANTES expression affects IFN responsiveness will require further study.Our study also presents a predictive model for IFN responsiveness based on a small number of signature genes. Although variants of the IL28B/IFNλ3 gene have recently been found to be highly predictive of the response to IFN/ribavirin in HCV-infected patients [11]–[15], there has been a paucity of mechanistic insights. Clearly, intrahepatic type III IFN levels of hepatitis C patients are not affected by IL28B polymorphism [42], [52], nor is it the case in primary hepatocyte cultures infected by HCV in vitro [40], [53]. Thus, the underlying mechanism for differential response in HCV-infected patients remains largely unknown. In our study we show that the expression of RSAD2, IFI6, IFI16, STAT1, CCL5, and XAF1 was highly predictive of the eventual IFN responsiveness to IFN/ribavirin therapy. Future studies will elucidate why lower expression of STAT1 and XAF1 were predictive of IFN responsiveness while expression of RSAD2, IFI6, IFI16, and CCL5 were associated with a poorer response to therapy. The model must also be validated with external data, and though our model had high specificity, further refinement is needed to improve model sensitivity."
