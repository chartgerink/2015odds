"AXL expression is induced by HCV infection in vitro and in vivo and is genotype dependent
We previously demonstrated that infection of Huh-7 cells with HCV (JFH1 strain) induces the expression of AXL as well as its downstream target SOCS3 [13]. To further confirm the mechanism by which AXL and SOCS3 are induced during HCV infection, we examined their expression in Huh-7 cells containing a HCV subgenomic replicon (SGR), which expresses only non-structural viral proteins, and in cells containing fully replicating JFH1 virus. Both AXL and SOCS3 were up-regulated approximately 2 fold in JFH1 infected cells (minimum 2 passages, 1 week post infection, 90% infectivity), but were surprisingly down-regulated in a stable cell line of Huh-7s harbouring a genotype 2a SGR [19] (Fig 1A). SOCS1 demonstrated an opposite expression pattern, being up-regulated 2 fold in cells harbouring the SGR (p<0.05). To determine whether the AXL protein is activated and thus able to induce SOCS3 in JFH1 infected Huh-7 cells, we examined AXL phosphorylation at tyrosine 779 by western blot. Interestingly, both total AXL and phosphorylated AXL were up-regulated in JFH1 infected cells (Fig 1B). Furthermore, both glycosylation states of AXL, represented by bands at approximately 110 and 140 kDa, were increased in JFH1 infected cells. These data suggest that AXL may drive SOCS3 expression in these cells, as has been shown in other models [12,20]. 10.1371/journal.pone.0136227.g001
Fig 1 HCV infection mediates AXL expression in vitro and in vivo.
AXL and SOCS3 expression are significantly increased in JFH1 infected Huh-7 cells, but decreased in cells containing a genotype 2a HCV subgenomic replicon (SGR), which lacks structural proteins. This was demonstrated at the mRNA level by qPCR (A), and confirmed at the protein level by western blot (B). Genotype dependent (GT1>3) induction of AXL and SOCS3 was observed in HepG2 cells transfected with baculovirus expressing HCV core protein (C), as well as in Huh-7 cells infected with core chimeric HCV viruses (D) (* p<0.05, ** p<0.01). Data represents the mean and standard error of three biological replicates, each with duplicate samples. Because the HCV structural protein core has been shown to induce SOCS3 expression in vitro [6], we examined AXL/SOCS3 expression in HepG2 cells over-expressing genotype 1b and 3a HCV core protein, using a baculovirus expression system. At 48 h post-electroporation, genotype 1b core significantly up-regulated both AXL and SOCS3 by 4 and 3 fold respectively, while genotype 3a core up-regulated SOCS3 alone by 2 fold (Fig 1C). Next, we examined AXL and SOCS3 expression in Huh-7 cells harbouring chimeric HCV constructs, which express genotype 1b or 3a core in a JFH1 (genotype 2a) virus, and observed similar results. While both chimeric viruses replicated at lower levels than wild type JFH1 (S1 Fig), both induced significant AXL and SOCS3 up-regulation, albeit more potently following infection with the genotype 1b chimera (Fig 1D). Neither core expression nor chimeric virus induced the expression of SOCS1. HCV induced AXL expression is mediated by antiviral and inflammatory signalling pathways
To determine cell factors that may influence AXL expression, the UCSC genome browser was used to identify experimentally validated transcription factor binding sites within the AXL promoter/enhancer region (S2 Fig) [16]. The ECR Browser was used to identify evolutionarily conserved regions within the promoter and introns of the AXL gene, and rVISTA was used to find conserved transcription factor binding sites, using the Rattus Norvegicus genome as a reference (S3 Fig) [17,18]. A number of transcription factors that mediate innate immune signalling, including STAT1, 2 and 3, as well as AP-1 signalling components (c-Fos, c-Jun), have been shown to bind to the AXL gene, principally at intronic sequences in the 5’ region (Fig 2A). Furthermore, a number of evolutionarily conserved transcription factor binding sites were predicted in overlapping regions, including additional NFκB binding sites. 10.1371/journal.pone.0136227.g002
Fig 2 AXL expression is mediated by multiple innate immune signalling pathways.
To identify inflammatory transcription factor binding sites within the AXL promoter/enhancer region that may mediate AXL expression, the UCSC genome browser was interrogated for experimental ChIP binding sites (A). Furthermore, the ECR browser and rVista were used to identify evolutionarily conserved regions and to predict transcription factor binding sites, respectively. Huh-7 cells were treated with a range of antiviral cytokines for 24 h then AXL expression measured by qPCR (B). IFNs α, β, and λ up-regulated AXL more potently than pro-inflammatory cytokines IFNγ and IL6 (average of two biological replicates in duplicate for each). (C) To inhibit potential signalling components that induce AXL, Huh-7 cells were treated with 10nM siRNA against STAT1/STAT3 or chemical inhibitors of JNK (SP600125) or NFκB (BAY11-7082) for 24 h. Inhibition of STAT1, STAT3, JNK (SP600125) and NFκB (BAY 11–7082) all significantly reduced HCV induced AXL expression (* p<0.05, ** p<0.01, *** p<0.001) (average of three biological replicates in duplicate). Data represents the mean and standard error. To identify which innate immune cytokines that are typically induced by HCV can up-regulate AXL expression, we treated Huh-7 cells with IFNs α (1000 U/ml), β (1000 U/ml), γ (10ng/ml) and λ3 (10 and 100 ng/ml) as well as IL6 (50 ng/ml) for 24 h and measured AXL. Interestingly, all cytokines tested induced AXL expression, albeit to differing degrees, with type I interferons α and β having the strongest effect (Fig 2B). Potential IFNα mediated induction of other members of the TAM family of receptor tyrosine kinases (Tyro3 and Mer) was investigated, but only AXL was found to be an ISG (S4 Fig).
To better understand how AXL is induced following HCV infection, we inhibited multiple innate immune and inflammatory signalling pathways in JFH1 infected Huh-7 cells, using either siRNA or chemical inhibitors. STAT1 and STAT3 siRNAs were used to inhibit IFN and IL6 induced signalling pathways; SP600125 was used to inhibit JNK and downstream AP-1 signalling and BAY11-7082 was used to inhibit NFκB signalling. The efficacy of siRNA gene knockdown and all chemical inhibitors was confirmed by STAT1/3 western blot and NFκB/AP-1 promoter activation using luciferase reporter plasmids respectively (S5 Fig). Inhibition of STAT1 and 3, JNK or NFκB signalling each reduced AXL expression by approximately 2 fold (Fig 2C), suggesting that HCV mediated AXL expression is complex and is likely mediated by multiple transcription factors. Expression of SOCS1 and SOCS3 was unaffected (data not shown). AXL knockdown reduces SOCS3 expression but does not affect JFH1 replication
To determine the role of AXL in SOCS3 induction, as well as in the interferon response to HCV infection, AXL was knocked down in JFH1 infected Huh-7 cells using 10nM AXL siRNA. SiRNA mediated knock down of AXL by approximately 75% significantly reduced SOCS3 expression, by approximately 40% (Fig 3A). AXL knockdown was maintained for 24 h after 50 U/ml IFNα treatment, while SOCS3 expression remained down-regulated, albeit modestly (Fig 3B). AXL knockdown had no effect on HCV replication, either at baseline or following IFNα treatment (red triangles), nor did it have any effect on ISG expression (data not shown). 10.1371/journal.pone.0136227.g003
Fig 3 AXL knockdown reduces SOCS3 expression but does not affect HCV replication.
AXL specific siRNA knockdown reduced AXL expression by approximately 75%, also resulting in a significant reduction of SOCS3 by approximately 40% (A). AXL knockdown was maintained for 24 h after 50 U/ml IFNα stimulation, with a non-significant trend towards reduced SOCS3 expression (B). AXL knockdown did not reduce HCV viral replication following IFNα treatment (red triangles) (* p<0.05, ** p<0.01). Data represents the mean and standard error of two biological replicates performed in duplicate. AXL overexpression dampens the ISG response to IFNα in Huh-7 cells
Next, AXL was over-expressed in Huh-7 cells, to determine whether it can influence STAT1 phosphorylation, promoter activation and ISG expression in response to IFNα. Strong AXL overexpression was achieved following stable transfection with the PCMV6-AXL vector, with PCMV6-Entry as a control. This was confirmed by western blot, using antibodies against either AXL or the Myc protein tag (Fig 4A). In cells overexpressing AXL, IFNα (50 U/ml) induced a more transient activation of STAT1, characterised by stronger STAT1 phosphorylation 15 and 30 minutes post treatment, with reduced STAT1 phosphorylation at 60 minutes (Fig 4B). Furthermore, in AXL over-expressing Huh-7 cells, 50 U/ml IFNα induced activation of the interferon stimulated response element (ISRE) and NFκB was significantly blunted 8 h post-treatment, using luciferase reporter constructs (Fig 4C). In contrast, the gamma activated sequence (GAS) activation increased almost two fold at 4 h post treatment and no change in activation of the AP-1 promoter was observed in AXL overexpressing cells. Together, these data agree with previous reports in dendritic cells, suggesting that AXL highjacks signalling from the type I IFN receptor, thereby limiting ISRE and NFκB activation, and also produces STAT1 homodimers that bind the GAS sequence [12]. 10.1371/journal.pone.0136227.g004
Fig 4 AXL overexpression dampens the response to IFNα.
Stable transfection of Huh-7 cells with PCMV6-AXL was confirmed by western blot, using antibodies against AXL or the fusion Myc tag (A). Huh-7 cells overexpressing AXL induced a stronger but more transient phosphorylation of STAT1 (B), with increased phosphorylation at 15 and 30 minutes post-IFN (50 u/ml), but a strong decrease at 1 h (2 replicates). ISRE and NFκB promoter activation was decreased almost 2 fold at 8 h post-IFN treatment in cells overexpressing AXL, while GAS activation were increased 2 fold at 4 h post-IFN treatment (C). No effect on AP-1 promoter activation was observed (* p<0.05). Data represents the mean and standard error of two biological replicates performed in duplicate. We next examined ISG expression in response to IFNα to determine whether modulation of promoter activity by AXL (Fig 4) also reduces ISG expression. Huh-7 cells over-expressing AXL were significantly less responsive to 50 U/ml IFNα, with reduced induction of ISG15 and viperin (Fig 5A). Surprisingly, AXL overexpression had no effect on expression of SOCS1 (data not shown) or SOCS3 (Fig 5B), suggesting that in this model, AXL alone is likely responsible for regulation of IFNα signalling. To determine whether AXL exerts IFN regulatory and thus pro-viral effects, both control and AXL over-expressing Huh-7 cell lines were transfected with RNA for either full length HCV virus (JFH1 strain) or a JFH1-derived SGR, lacking structural. AXL over-expression increased viral replication over 2 fold for the SGR and 1.5 fold for JFH1 (Fig 5C), suggesting that AXL can weaken the antiviral response to HCV in vitro. 10.1371/journal.pone.0136227.g005
Fig 5 AXL overexpression dampens the antiviral response.
Following treatment with 50 U/ml IFNα, Huh-7 cells stably expressing AXL demonstrated blunted ISG15 and viperin expression (A), but no change in SOCS3 (B), compared to control cells. Stable AXL overexpression also mediated an increase in full length JFH1 and SGR viral replication at 24 h post-transfection (C) (* p<0.05, ** p<0.01). Data represents the mean and standard error of three biological replicates performed in duplicate. AXL and SOCS3 are up-regulated in HCV infected liver
To determine whether our in vitro results mimic in vivo gene expression, we compared liver biopsies from patients infected with HCV genotype 1 or 3, with HBV infected livers as controls. Both AXL and SOCS3 were significantly up-regulated in genotype 1 infected livers compared to HBV controls, whereas SOCS3 was only significantly higher in the genotype 3 infected livers (Fig 6A). Both AXL and SOCS3 were significantly increased in HCV infected livers with low (F0-2) or high (F3-4) levels of fibrosis, compared to low fibrosis HBV liver biopsies, indicating that AXL expression is not affected by fibrosis stage (Fig 6B). A strong correlation was also observed between hepatic AXL expression and HCV viral load (Fig 6C), suggesting that increased viral replication and subsequent activation of immune signalling pathways may drive AXL expression in the liver. 10.1371/journal.pone.0136227.g006
Fig 6 HCV genotype and IFNL3 SNP modulate AXL expression.
AXL and SOCS3 expression were examined in liver biopsies from patients with chronic HBV or chronic HCV infection, to look for virus specific differences in gene induction. HCV Genotype 1 infected livers demonstrated significantly higher expression of both SOCS3 and AXL (A), with no effect of liver fibrosis grade on expression of either SOCS3 of AXL in HCV infected livers (B). AXL expression also demonstrated a strong correlation with viral load, supporting the direct role of HCV in AXL induction (C). The rs12979860 IFNL3 CC SNP correlated with lower baseline hepatic AXL expression in genotype 1 HCV infected livers and JFH1 infected PHHs (D). PBMC expression of AXL was up-regulated in HCV infected individuals, and similar to hepatic expression, was lower in patients possessing the CC genotype (E). Stronger AXL up-regulation in PBMCs 12 h after the first IFN injection was also observed (F) (* p<0.05, ** p<0.01). We next examined AXL expression in liver and blood from HCV infected patients, stratified by the IFNL3 rs12979860 SNP. Hepatic AXL expression was higher in patients with the non-responder rs12979860 CT/TT genotype (Fig 6D), consistent with published data showing elevated hepatic ISGs in patients possessing the IFNL3 non-responder haplotype [3,14]. To examine the effect of IFNL3 genotype on AXL in a PHH model, we utilized publicly available microarray data examining expression of primary human hepatocytes (PHHs) infected with HCV (Geo Dataset GSE54648). Laser capture microdissection was utilized to compare infected and infection adjacent cells, and was further stratified by IFNL3 rs12979860 genotype [21]. By analysing AXL expression in both infected and adjacent PHHs (gene expression results combined to simulate in vivo infection) we found similar results as in vivo HCV infection, with elevated AXL expression in HCV infected PHH isolated from patients with the “non-responder” rs12979860 CT/TT genotype (Fig 6D).
To determine whether AXL induction is mediated directly by viral infection or by subsequent cytokine expression, we examined AXL expression in infected, adjacent and mock infected PHHs from the same dataset. AXL expression increased in infected cells from day 1 to day 7 (S6 Fig), and was consistently higher in infected cells than either adjacent cells or mock infected controls (p<0.05 vs mock, day 3). This suggests that although cytokines may contribute to AXL expression in vivo, AXL up-regulation occurs primarily in infected cells.
AXL expression was also significantly elevated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from HCV infected individuals (n = 20) compared to healthy controls (n = 15) (p<0.05) (Fig 6E). Furthermore, patients possessing the responder rs12979860 CC genotype displayed lower AXL expression than CT/TT carriers, in agreement with hepatic AXL expression. Finally, induction of AXL 12 h after the first dose of pegylated IFN was stronger in PBMCs from patients possessing the responder CC genotype, compared with CT/TT non-responder patients (Fig 6F).
We previously demonstrated that AXL is up-regulated following HCV infection in vitro, and may contribute to SOCS3 expression and interferon refractoriness [13]. We now demonstrate that AXL is induced in a genotype dependent manner (GT1>3) in vitro as well as in vivo, and is likely induced by IFNs and other inflammatory mediators. AXL knockdown showed little effect on IFN signalling, however AXL overexpression reduced Huh-7 responsiveness to IFN, as well as the antiviral response against HCV.Our current findings build on our previous report that HCV induces AXL expression in vitro. We have now clarified (1) that viral replication alone, in the absence of HCV structural proteins, is not sufficient to induce AXL/SOCS3 expression, and (2) that genotype 1 core protein, either alone or as part of a chimeric virus, is a more potent inducer of AXL/SOCS3 than genotype 3 core (Fig 1). The similar expression pattern of AXL and SOCS3 suggests that AXL may induce SOCS3 in our model, particularly in the presence of genotype 1 core protein, and we have confirmed the association with HCV genotype in human liver tissue (Fig 6). This suggests that AXL may drive increased expression of SOCS3, which has been implicated in genotype 1 mediated insulin resistance and treatment non-response [22–25].Because type I IFN has been shown to induce AXL in myeloid cells in the blood [11,12,26], we sought to determine whether we could reproduce AXL induction in Huh-7 cells. Surprisingly, the inflammatory cytokines IL6 and IFNγ only modestly up-regulated AXL, while type I/III IFNs (β>α>λ) potently induced its expression. Knockdown of STAT1/3 or chemical inhibition of JNK or NFκB signalling all reduced AXL expression in JFH1 infected Huh-7 cells, suggesting that AXL induction is mediated by multiple transcription factors, similar to the IFNβ enhanceosome [27]. Because HCV induces oxidative stress, inflammation, and a strong type III immune response in the liver, it is not surprising that the activation of these transcription factors following infection in vitro induced AXL expression [28–33].Our experiments modulating AXL expression yielded conflicting results, concerning effects on ISGs and SOCS3. Although AXL knockdown reduced baseline SOCS3 expression, AXL overexpression had no effect on SOCS3. Conversely, ISG expression was not affected by AXL knockdown but was reduced following AXL overexpression. Together, these data suggest that AXL induced SOCS3 expression does not affect ISG expression, but rather AXL itself interferes with IFN signalling in Huh-7 cells. AXL knockdown did not increase ISG expression, suggesting that baseline expression of AXL in Huh-7 cells is insufficient to affect IFN signalling. Nonetheless, AXL overexpression significantly decreased IFN induced ISG expression and increased viral replication in Huh-7 cells, indicating that it has the capacity to interfere with signal transduction in hepatocytes. As such, we propose a model where in hepatocytes AXL binds to IFNAR1 to inhibit STAT1:2 heterodimer formation (reducing ISRE activation, ISG expression), induces STAT1 homodimer formation (increasing GAS activation), as demonstrated by Rothlin et al. [12] in dendritic cells, but does not induce SOCS1/SOCS3 expression.Finally, we observed a trend towards lower hepatic AXL expression and a stronger ISG response in blood PBMCs among patients with the favourable rs12979860 IFNL3 allele (CC), although this was not statistically significant, possibly due to insufficient statistical power. These data mirror previous reports, that the IFNL3 non-responder haplotype is associated with higher baseline ISGs in the liver and a weaker immune response in the blood [14,34,35], but provide a novel mechanism to explain this. Because AXL expression is induced by type I and III IFNs, it is likely that the recently described IFNL4 also induces AXL. IFNL4 is only expressed in the livers of patients with the unfavourable SNP (ss469415590), so IFNL4 driven AXL could potentially reduce the antiviral response to exogenous IFN in these individuals. Nonetheless, because AXL is an ISG, it may have the ability to regulate its own expression, and possibly the expression of other negative regulators such as USP18. This adds another layer of complexity to IFN regulation, and clearly requires further study.The consequences of HCV mediated AXL up-regulation are not limited to regulation of IFN signalling. Up-regulation of AXL is well documented in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and contributes to HCC cell line proliferation, migration and invasion [36–38], through activation of AKT and MAPK signalling pathways (reviewed in [39]). Moreover, AXL serves as an entry factor for a number of enveloped viruses, including the related dengue flavivirus [40–42]. If the same is true for HCV, immune-driven AXL expression in hepatocytes in the HCV infected liver could facilitate the spread of the virus into uninfected cells.In summary, we have shown that AXL is induced by HCV infection, and is capable of regulating the ISG response to HCV in hepatocytes. The immunomodulatory role of AXL in the context of IFNL3/4 polymorphisms remains uncertain, but may provide a mechanism for the differences observed in hepatic and blood ISG regulation, based on the dominant IFNs in each cell type."
