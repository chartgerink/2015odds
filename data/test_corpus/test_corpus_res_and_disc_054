"GC rs7041 G>T, GC rs4588 C>A, CYP2R1 rs10741657 G>A, CYP27B1 rs10877012 G>T polymorphismsGenotype frequencies of HCV infected patients were not found to significantly differ from what expected from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium equation. GC rs7041 G>T and rs4588 C>A polymorphisms, which spans 11 bases from each other on GC globulin gene, were found to be in linkage disequilibrium (r2=0.442). Allele frequencies of all polymorphisms were similar in patients and in control subjects, except for the G allele of CYP27B1 which was found to be slightly more frequent in control subjects than in patients (0.798 Vs 0.723, p=0.033). Viral responseRVR was achieved by 103 patients (50.0%), cEVR by 150 (72.8%), EOT by 157 (76.2%) and SVR by 131 (63.6%) patients. The association between the achievement of SVR and the main clinical and demographic variables known to influence antiviral response is reported in table 2. In all patients, SVR rate was greatly influenced by HCV genotype, IL-28B rs12979860 C>T polymorphism, baseline cholesterol, γ-GT and 25-OH vitamin D serum levels. In difficult to treat HCV genotypes, besides the prominent role exerted by IL-28B rs12979860 C>T polymorphism, the rate of SVR was influenced by baseline γ-GT, HCV RNA, cholesterol and 25-OH vitamin D serum levels. 10.1371/journal.pone.0080764.t002Table 2 Rates of sustained viral response in chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infected patients treated with pegylated interferon-α and ribavirin in relationship to baseline demographic and clinical predictors.

The carriage of GC rs7041 G, of GC rs4588 C, of CYP2R1 rs10741657 G and of CYP27B1 T allele was found to be related with SVR achievement, although the relationship did not reach the statistical significance in all but one case. According to the VDPFA genetic model, patients were then stratified in three groups: those carrying ≤4 functional alleles (N=108), those carrying 5-6 functional alleles (N=78) and those carrying ≥7 functional alleles (N=20). A strong significant association was found between the rates of cEVR, EOT, SVR achievement and the number of VDPFA functional alleles carried, either in all (cEVR: 73/108, 58/78, 19/20, p=0.017; EOT: 76/108, 62/78, 19/20, p=0.013; SVR: 61/108, 53/78, 17/20, p=0.009; Figure 1, panel A) and in difficult to treat HCV genotype (cEVR: 24/56, 25/43, 7/8, p=0.013; EOT: 29/56, 29/43, 7/8, p=0.025; SVR: 17/56, 23/43, 6/8, p=0.003; Figure 1, panel B). More interestingly, in patients who don’t achieve RVR a strong association was observed between SVR and VDPFA genetic value, either in all (12/55, 17/39, 7/9, p<0.001) and in difficult to treat HCV genotypes (4/41, 12/31, 5/6, p=0.001, Figure 2). 10.1371/journal.pone.0080764.t003Table 3 Rates of sustained viral response (SVR) in relationship with GC rs7041 G>T, GC rs4588 C>A, CYP2R1 rs10741657 G>A, CYP27B1 rs10877012 G>T polymorphic loci allele frequencies.

Statistical analysis was performed by means of chi-square test for linear trend. VDPFA genetic model and clinical and demographic variablesA significant association was observed between low 25(OH) vitamin D serum levels (≤15 ng/mL) and a VDPFA value ≤5 in all patients (52/147 Vs 11/59; p=0.018) while it tended to be significant in difficult to treat HCV genotypes (29/79 Vs 4/28; p=0.027). No association was detected between VDPFA values and the main clinical and demographic variables included in table 2. In particular, no relationship was detected at all, between VDPFA value ≤5 and IL-28B rs12979860 T/* polymorphism (95/147 Vs 35/59; p=0.48). Multivariate analysisStepwise logistic regression analysis was performed to assess whether a VDPFA value (>5 Vs ≤5) could be considered an independent predictor of SVR, in all and in difficult to treat HCV genotypes (table 4). Besides the main known predictors of SVR (HCV genotype, IL28B polymorphism and basal HCV RNA levels), a VDPFA value >5 was found to be independently associated with SVR in all (O.R. 2.30, 95% C.I. 1.02-5.22, p=0.040) and in difficult to treat (O.R. 3.19, 95% C.I. 1.08-9.40, p=0.038) HCV genotypes. Table 5 shows in all and in difficult to treat HCV genotypes who don’t achieve RVR the independent predictors of achieving SVR. In difficult to treat HCV genotypes VDPFA score (>5 Vs ≤5) was found to be an independent predictor of SVR (O.R. 4.48, C.I. 95%: 1.19-16.8; p=0.026) as well as serum γ−GT, serum cholesterol levels and the use of pegylated interferon alfa 2b. 10.1371/journal.pone.0080764.t004Table 4 Stepwise logistic regression analysis in identifying the independent predictors of sustained viral response.

This study dealt with genes and their functional polymorphic loci known to be able to influence the serum vitamin D levels: rs10741657 G>A of CYP2R1, rs7041 G>T and rs4588 C>A of GC-globulin and rs10877012 G>T of CYP27B1. The allele frequencies of the gene polymorphic loci studied were similar in patients with chronic hepatitis C and controls; the only exception was represented by the G allele of CYP27B1 rs10877012 G>T found to be slightly more frequent in control subjects than in patients. It must be pointed out that in our patients the allele frequencies were very similar to those detected by Lange et al. in a European cohort of patients with chronic hepatitis C [19,20].Genome wide association, meta-analysis and large population studies have proved that some genetic determinants are able to predict 25(OH) vitamin D serum concentrations [16,21,22]. Major contribution to serum 25(OH) vitamin D variations appears to be related to GC-globulin gene common genetic polymorphisms. GC rs7041 G>T and rs4588 C>A polymorphisms generate three genetically determined isoforms of this globulin: GC-1s (rs7041G/rs4588C), GC-1f (rs7041T/rs4588C) and GC-2 (rs7041T/rs4588A). The isoforms differ in their amino-acid sequences in position 432 (Glu>Asp) and 436 (Thr>Lys); these modifications produce changes in serum GC-globulin levels in turn associated with variations in serum 25(OH) vitamin D values [16]. Therefore, although appearing in linkage disequilibrium, both polymorphisms were considered in this study. CYP2R1 is expressed only in the liver and is highly conserved among species; it is active in the 25-hydroxylation of both vitamin D2 and D3. CYP2R1 rs10741657 G>A polymorphism, located 2 kb upstream from the gene, is one of the main polymorphisms found to be associated with 25(OH) vitamin D circulating levels [21,23]. CYP27B1 gene, located on chromosome 11q13.1, is differently regulated in various tissues. In kidney CYP27B1 expression is up-regulated by parathyroid hormone and down-regulated by FGF-23; in contrast, in inflammatory cells, this hydroxylase expression-activity has been found to be regulated by cytokines such as interferon-γ and interleukin-15 [15]. CYP27B1 rs10877012 G>T is a functional polymorphism located in the promoter region of this 1α-hydroxylase. Although a genome wide association study did not detect a relationship between this polymorphic locus and 25(OH) vitamin D levels, in a larger study a strong association was found [22]; furthermore it has been shown that the GG wild type of rs10877012 locus impairs the expression of this enzyme [24]. Finally, Lange et al. demonstrated that this polymorphism could influence serum levels of 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D in HCV positive patients [19].Twin and family studies have reported that 25(OH) vitamin D levels are moderate to high (from 20 to 80%) hereditable [25]. These observations support the idea to construct a genetic model starting from the known functional polymorphisms of genes involved in vitamin D pathway. In effect, a simply genetic model was firstly proposed by Signorello et al. to predict serum 25(OH) vitamin D concentrations [26]. This Author combined the carriage of risk alleles of some GC-globulin and CYP27B1 gene polymorphisms. An inverse relationship was observed between the sum of risk alleles carried and the serum levels of vitamin D. Starting from this finding, it could be reasonable to assess whether, besides basal vitamin D serum levels, a relationship might exist between the VDPFA value and the rate of SVR obtainment with standard dual therapy in patients with HCV chronic infection.To construct this genetic model, the four polymorphisms studied were singularly associated with SVR obtainment: a positive odd ratio was detected for the major G and C alleles of GC-globulin, the major G allele of CYP2R1 and the minor T allele of CYP27B1. These functional alleles were therefore considered to be potentially implicated in favoring the SVR achievement. Singularly, each polymorphic locus appeared to be weakly related to SVR, with the exception of CYP2R1 rs10741657 when evaluated in all patients. Nevertheless, stratifying the patients for the VDPFA score, the rate of SVR was strongly associated with this index, in all patients and separately in those infected by HCV 1/4-5 genotypes. Taking into account the latter group, patients having a VDPFA value ≤4 achieved SVR in 30.4% of the cases, those having a VDPFA value between 5-6 in 53.3% and finally those having a VDPFA value ≥7 in 75.0%. Interestingly, in patients who did not achieve RVR, VDPFA scores were able to predict more strongly SVR obtainment (9.8%, 38.7% and 83.3% for VDPFA value ≤4, between 5-6 and ≥7 respectively). No association at all was observed between the VDPFA value and the rate of RVR. Finally, VDPFA value was found to be related with serum 25(OH) vitamin D levels, whilst it was unrelated with the main clinical and demographic variables pertaining to patients affected by chronic hepatitis C.Our results are in agreement with those reported by Lange et al. who demonstrated that CYP27B1 rs10877012 polymorphism, incorporated into our VDPFA model, was associated with the rate of SVR in patients infected by HCV genotypes 1, 2 and 3 [19]. Interestingly in a second study this author observed an influence of this polymorphism in predicting SVR in patients carrying the IL-28B rs12979860 C/T and T/T genotypes [20]. It must be pointed out that in the present study the VDPFA model was found to be a predictor of SVR independently from the main IL-28B rs12979860 polymorphism. VDPFA involves polymorphisms of genes implied either in furnishing 25(OH) vitamin D and in the intra-cellular activation from 25(OH) to 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D. It may be suggested that the availability of the precursor and the degree of the local bio-activation are both relevant for the final efficacious effect of vitamin D. Finally, at variance to what occurs for basal vitamin D, VDPFA strongly associates with SVR attainment but not with the achievement of RVR. In this regard, it should be emphasized that basal vitamin D levels may predict the early phases of antiviral treatment, while this effect could subsequently decline [9]. On the contrary, one may argue that genetic polymorphisms effects must be considered constant over time. It may be postulated that the capacity of induce a positive response to antiviral therapy in chronic HCV infection could be influenced by the carriage of genetic variants of genes involved in vitamin D metabolic pathway, in turn conditioning vitamin D bioavailability.This study has two main limitations: the design was retrospective and it analyzed only Caucasian subjects of North-Italy. Thus a validation prospective cohort of patients should be analyzed to confirm these preliminary results. Moreover, these results would be replicated in patients of other ethnicities carrying different allelic frequencies of the four polymorphic loci evaluated. However, on a clinical point of view, having a VDPFA value ≥7 could aid to select, among naïve difficult to treat HCV genotypes, a sub-group of RVR negative patients still candidates for successfully remaining in standard dual therapy without reducing the rates of SVR achievement."
