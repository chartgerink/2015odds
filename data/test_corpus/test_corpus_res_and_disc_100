"Patients Table 2 shows the main demographic and clinical characteristics of the 123 patients that had DNA available, of the 99 patients selected for the pharmacogenetic study of efficacy and of the 113 patients assessed for the pharmacogenetic study of safety. Demographic and clinical characteristics of these 123 subjects did not differ significantly from those of individuals who had not stored DNA available (n = 59). Of note, there was a population admixture regarding HCV genotypes (Table 2). 10.1371/journal.pone.0047725.t002 Table 2 Main demographic and clinical characteristics of the groups studied.

Efficacy analyses Table 3 shows the association between the genotypes and alleles assessed and each type of virological response. RVR was associated with IL28B rs8099917 SNP, carriers of T allele had the greater association with response, and with CTLA4 rs231775 SNP, carriers of the A allele were associated with better response. No associations were observed with EVR. SVR was otherwise associated with the IL28B rs8099917 SNP, carriers of the T allele being associated with better outcome. After analysing the linkage disequilibrium among the polymorphisms studied, only an association between CCL5 rs2280789 and rs2107538 SNPs was found (D′ = 1; 95%IC = 0.87–1). The reconstructed haplotypes of these polymorphisms were not associated with SVR (p = 0.14). 10.1371/journal.pone.0047725.t003 Table 3 Association between the different types of virological response and the genetic variants assessed.

Note: the remaining genetic variants assessed showed no significant associations with RVR, EVR and SVR (p>0.05 for all comparisons). Univariate analysis of SVR, which included several clinical, virological and therapy variables, indicated that HCV genotypes 2+3, RVR and EVR, beaides of carriage of the IL28B rs8099917 T allele, were significantly associated with SVR (Table 4). To determine whether the IL28B rs8099917 SNP was independently associated with SVR, we constructed a multivariate regression model which included the variables reported to be significantly associated with SVR in the univariate analysis. After adjustment for other covariates, the IL28B rs8099917 T allele remained significantly associated with SVR, compared with the G allele (Table 5). 10.1371/journal.pone.0047725.t004 Table 4 Association of clinical, biochemical, and therapeutic factors with SVR in patients who completed the scheduled 48-week treatment regimen with pegIFNα and ribavirin.

Note: the remaining genetic variants assessed showed no significant associations with any of the adverse effects (p>0.05 for all comparisons). We performed an univariate analysis of the association of the six categories of adverse effects defined and the clinical, virological and therapy variables that were assessed in the safety substudy (the variables used are detailed in Table 4). Among continuous variables, the significant associations observed were: flu-like syndrome with higher weight (71.1±12.7 vs. 65.2±9 k.; p = 0.02); depression with higher HIV plasma viral load (median 199 copies/mL, 25–75% IQR 49–298 vs. median 49 copies/mL, 25–75% IQR 39–199; p = 0.045), neutropenia with lower CD4 T-cell count (median 508 cells/mL, 25–75% IQR 340–769 vs. median 591 cells/mL, 25–75% IQR 497–800; p = 0.03) and thrombocytopenia with lower CD4 T-cell count (median 511 cells/mL, 25–75% IQR 383–704 vs. non neutropenic: median 611 cells/mL, 25–75% IQR 473–816; p = 0.049). Among categoric variables, the only significant associations observed were: neutropenia with pegIFNα 2a vs. 2b (OR 2.6, 95CI 1.2–5.7, p = 0.01), and with female vs. male gender (OR 2.7, 95%CI 1.1–6.4, p = 0.02); and thrombocytopenia with pegIFNα 2a vs. 2b (OR 2.9, 95%CI 1.3–6.3, p = 0.008). For multivariate analyses, we constructed a logistic regression model which included the adverse effects categories that were associated with more than one clinical, analytical, virological or genetic variable in the univariate analysis. The only adverse effects that fulfilled these criteria were neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. With respect to neutropenia we constructed a multivariate regression model which included the following variables: gender, type of pegIFNα prescribed, CD4 cell count stratified in two categories (≤350 and >350 cells/mL) and SOCS3 rs4969170 genotype. The use of pegIFNα 2a and CD4 cell count ≤350 cells/mL was associated with greater risk of neutropenia while carriers of the SOCS3 rs4969170 AG genotype had significantly lower risk of neutropenia. Regarding thrombocytopenia, the model included the type of pegIFNα prescribed, stratified CD4 cell count, and SOCS3 rs4969170 genotype. Patients treated with pegIFNα 2a had significantly higher risk of thrombocytopenia, and carriers of the SOCS3 rs4969170 AA genotype had significantly lower risk of thrombocytopenia (Table 7). 10.1371/journal.pone.0047725.t007 Table 7 Independent predicitive factors of adverse effects.

Given that HCV treatment is of long duration, has potentially serious adverse effects and is expensive, several attempts have been made to identify the factors that predict a successful outcome [3]–[5]. Our previous study identified that factors associated with treatment outcome are: age, HCV viral load and HCV genotype [18]. This pharmacogenetic substudy shows that the IL28B rs8099917 polymorphism is associated with SVR to hepatitis C therapy in HCV-HIV co-infected patients and therefore confirms the results that have been reported in many other studies performed in HCV mono-infected [9]–[13] and in HCV-HIV co-infected patients [14]–[17]. A new finding from our study is the association between HCV treatment-induced neutropenia and thrombocytopenia and the SOCS3 rs4969170 polymorphism.As far as cytokines are concerned and besides IL28B, we have assessed the effect of polymorphism in genes encoding for diverse cytokines, such as IL6, IL10, TNFα and IFNγ, given that they are involved in the immunological response to HCV [6], [7], [25], [26]. The genes that encode for these cytokines are polymorphic and genetic variants may have functional significance at the protein level. Despite this, our data do not show any significant associations between IL6, IL10, TNFα and IFNγ polymorphisms and virological response to treatment with pegIFNα and ribavirin. Our results agree, therefore, with the lack of association found between polymorphism in these cytokine-encoding genes and virological response to HCV treatment [27]–[29]. Nevertheless, the data from the present study do not confirm the positive association between virological response and IL6 [7] and IL10 [6], [30] polymorphisms. The reasons for this discrepancy may be due to the low number of patients assessed in some investigations [6], [7], [30] as well as in the current study, which means unstable and, often, non-replicable data. Differences in the type of population assessed (HCV mono-infected vs. HCV-HIV co-infected) and in the type of HCV treatment used (interferon monotherapy vs. pegIFNα plus ribavirin) may offer additional explanation.With respect to chemokines, we have assessed CCL5. The expression of CCL5 is enhanced in liver and in blood by HCV and successful HCV treatment supressess this upregulation [31]. Previous studies in HCV monoinfected patients have shown that CCL5 rs2107538 SNP and some CCL5 haplotypes are associated with HCV treatment response [32], [33] although data are inconsistent [34]. Of note, several patients in these studies were treated with standard interferon α rather than with pegIFNα. The current study is the first one performed in HCV-HIV coinfected subjects and our data suggest no relationship between CCL5 gene polymorphisms and SVR. Haplotyping confirmed this lack of association. Differences between our results and those provided by other investigations [32], [33] may be searched in the population assessed (HCV monoinfected vs. HCV-HIV coinfected) and/or in the type of interferon used (standart interferon α vs. pegIFNα). Furthermore, no association was observed between CCL5 gene polymorphisms and the different types of adverse effects assessed.We also assessed the role of polymorphisms in the interferon pathway given that IFNα increases the expression of several genes involved in the immunological response to HCV [35]. IFNα has a potent antiviral action that is exerted indirectly through a complex mechanism [36] in which the myxovirus resistance protein A (MxA), the oligoadenylate synthase 1 (OAS1) and the suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) are involved [37]. The genes that encode for MxA, OAS1 and SOCS3 are polymorphic and it has been assessed whether polymorphism in these genes modulate the response to interferon in HCV monoinfected subjects [38], [39]. The SOCS3 −487A allele increases SOCS3 expression and was associated with pegIFNα and ribavirin HCV treatment failure [38]. Furthermore, carriage of the MxA −88G>T allele, was associated with a better response of HCV to interferon and polymorphism located in OAS1 gene was shown to be associated with spontaneous HCV clearance [39]. Our data in the current study in HCV-HIV coinfected subjects indicates that MxA, OAS1 and SOCS3 SNPs are not associated with HCV treatment efficacy and therefore confirm the results of previous investigations [40]. A new finding from our study was the association of the SOCS3 rs4969170 polymorphism with HCV treatment-induced neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Plausible biological explanation can be searched in the fact that in studies in knockout mice, SOCS3 has been shown to be implicated in both granulopoiesis [41] and thrombopoiesis [42].CTLA4 is a polypeptide involved in the processing of antigens by T-cell lymphocytes and influences the response of HCV to interferon. Three studies have assessed the relationship between the polymorphisms rs231776 (+49A>G) and rs5247909 (−318C>A) in the CTLA4 gene and HCV treatment response, either in HCV monoinfected patients [43], [44] and in HCV/HIV co-infected individuals [45]. Despite some discrepancies regarding the effect of gender or the type of interferon α used, data from these studies were consistent with an association between the two polymorphsms assessed and SVR. This association was particularly robust in carriers of the +49 GG genotype [45]. Our data do not replicate this findings since we found no significant associations between polymorphism in the CTLA4 gene and SVR. Reasons for discrepancy may be seek in the lower number of patients in our study compared with that of other investigations, which suggest underpower. Genuine population differences may offer an additional explanation.Polymorphism in the ITPA gene has been related with a benign erythrocyte enzymopathy, which is characterized by the accumulation of ITP in red cells. The affected patients may develop anemia when they are treated with purine analogues. Ribavirin is a purine analogue and previous studies have shown that ITPA genetic variants leading to ITPA deficiency are associated with ribavirin-induced anemia in HCV-treated patients [46]. This association has been replicated in studies performed in HCV-monoinfected [47]–[50] and in HCV-HIV co-infected [51] patients. In our Spanish cohort, however, we were unable to reproduce these findings, since no significant associations were observed between the two ITPA gene variants assessed and ribavirin-induced anemia and/or the need of ribavirin dose reduction. Additionally, we failed to find any significant association between ITPA SNPs and neutropenia. Also, we did not find associations between ITPA polymorphisms and thrombocytopenia, a finding that has been reported in two independent cohorts [52], [53]. As virological response is concerned, our data do not suggest any association between ITPA genetic variants and virological response. Our data therefore agrees with that reported by Chayama et al. [54], but differs markedly from that provided by Ochi [47] and Kurosaki [55]. It is unlikely that population differences could explain this discrepancy, since these three studies have been performed in Japanese.We acknowledge that our work has some limitations that should be taken into account when interpreting the data. The number of patients assessed is low for a genetic association analysis and this may render our study underpowered for finding some significant associations. We believe, however, that studies performed with a phenotypically well-defined population such as ours may provide useful material for performing meta-analyses which could overcome issues of small sample size. Additionally, our cohort had a mixture of HCV genotypes. Since HCV genotype is a strong determinant of HCV treatment response, this could be a bias in our study. Despite these limitations, this is the first pharmacogenetic study arising from a randomised clinical trial performed in HCV-HIV co-infected patients and we believe that this design gives additional value to our findings.In summary, in HCV-HIV co-infected patients treated with PegIFNα and ribavirin, SVR is associated with IL28B rs8099917 polymorphism. Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia are associated with SOCS3 r4969170 polymorphism."
