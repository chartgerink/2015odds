"Patients
Eighty-one patients were enrolled in 17 centers. The principal baseline demographic and disease characteristics of the studied population are shown in Table 1. Of the 81 patients, 61 (76%) were men and their mean age was 55.8±9.7 years [33.0–74.0]. In terms of the severity of HCV recurrence, 19 (24%) were cirrhotic patients, and nine (11%) experienced a CH. Forty-four (54%) had previously been treated with PEG-IFN/RBV after LT. Their prior therapeutic responses had been a relapse or virological breakthrough in 16 cases (20%), a partial response in ten cases (12%) and a null response in 18 cases (22%). Thirty-seven (46%) patients were naive of anti-HCV therapy after LT. Thirty-six (44%) and 45 (56%) patients have received BOC and TVR, respectively. Fifty-five patients (68%) completed a 4W lead-in phase, including 19 patients in the TVR group. The median time elapsing between LT and triple therapy was 36 months [24–84]. The mean duration of antiviral therapy was 42.7±37.7 W [1–49], and was similar in both groups (P = 0.87). As for immunosuppressive regimens, there were no differences in the choice of CNI and the number of immunosuppressive drugs between the BOC and TVR groups (Table 2). At baseline, 76 patients (94%) received a CNI. Most patients received at least two or three immunosuppressive agents. 10.1371/journal.pone.0138091.t001

Forty-five patients (56%) presented with elevated bilirubin levels prior to treatment (mean: 33.4±55.6 μmol/L [7–372]). Among these, 25 (55%) reduced, 15 (33%) stabilized and five (11%) increased their bilirubin levels at the end of therapy, respectively. When normal at baseline, no patient experienced an increase of bilirubin level up to 50 μmol/L during treatment and achieved normalization when treatment was discontinued.
At baseline, the median MELD score was 9.5 [6.0–12.6]. At the end of therapy, this MELD score was 7.2 [6.0–9.5] (p = ns). The reduction in the MELD score was particularly significant in patients with CH and in those with an F4 METAVIR score: the median MELD scores fell from 12.1 [10.0–13.4] to 8.2 [6.0–9.2] and from 12.0 [9.5–13.9] to 9.1 [7.2–11.7], respectively (p = 0.021 and p = 0.047). Virological responses (Fig 1) 10.1371/journal.pone.0138091.g001
Fig 1 Virological responses during triple therapy after liver transplantation.
An early virological response (EVR) was observed when the HCV viral load was undetectable at week 12. An extended virological response meant negative HCV RNA at week 4 and week 12. An EOT (end of treatment response) was achieved when HCV RNA was undetectable at 48 weeks. SVR12 and SVR 24 were defined as undetectable HCV RNA at 12 and 24 weeks after the discontinuation of antiviral therapy, respectively. Five patients discontinued triple therapy (three with TVR and two with BOC) before week 48 with undetectable HCV RNA and still achieved an SVR12 and SVR24. An EVR and eRVR were achieved in 52 (64%) and 31 (38%) patients, respectively. Thirty-eight patients (47%) achieved a SVR12 and SVR24 in this cohort, 19 (53%) with BOC and 19 (42%) with TVR (p = 0.344). Stepwise logistic regression showed that achieving an EVR was the most robust independent factor for SVR12 and SVR24 (OR = 49.4, 95%CI [5.7–421.3], p<0.00001). Among the 52 patients with an EVR, 38 (73%) achieved a SVR24. A lead-in phase did not impact the SVR24 (p = 0.821).
Baseline characteristics such as a bilirubin level <17μmol/L (OR = 5.5, 95%CI [1.4–21.4], p = 0.015), an albumin level >35g/L (OR = 4.6, 95%CI [1.1–19.3], P = 0.037) and an initial dosage of RBV dosage of ≥800mg/day (OR = 9.8, 95%CI [2.1–44.6], P = 0.003) had a significant and positive impact on both the SVR12 and SVR24 (Table 3). If no premature discontinuation of therapy due to SAE was necessary, this also had an impact on SVR rates (OR = 6.3, 95%CI [1.3–31.1], p = 0.022). 10.1371/journal.pone.0138091.t003

Concerning the immunosuppressive regimen, the use of cyclosporine and the avoidance of steroids were both significantly associated with a SVR24 under univariate analysis (p = 0.014 and p = 0.040, respectively).
Depending on the response to a previous course of PEG-IFN/RBV therapy after LT, there was a trend towards a lower SVR24 rate among null-responders when compared to relapsers (6/18 (33%) versus 6/11 (53%), P = 0.190).
It was not possible to detect any influence of genotype 1a (11/25 (44%)) versus 1b (26/55 (47%), P = 0.814), recipient IL28B polymorphism (P = 0.098) or baseline HCV VL (P = 0.582) on SVR24.
Depending on the fibrosis stage, a SVR24 was achieved in 26/47 (57%) of ≤F2 patients and in 12/34 (35%) of ≥F3 patients (P = 0.06). The SVR24 rate was lower in cirrhotic patients (7/19 (37%)) and among the nine FCH patients, while three patients (33%) achieved an SVR24.
Premature discontinuation according to the stopping rules occurred in 22 patients (27%) (Fig 2). Among the eight patients who experienced a virological breakthrough, complete NS3 sequencing was performed in six of them and at least one mutation related to PI resistance was detected in three (50%) (T54A, V36M, R155K). Three (8%) and one (2%) patients experienced a relapse after completing 48W of therapy with BOC or TVR, respectively (P = 0.11). All relapses occurred during the first 12W following treatment discontinuation. 10.1371/journal.pone.0138091.g002
Fig 2 Flowchart describing premature discontinuations and treatment failures.
Among the patients who discontinued treatment because of adverse events, five nevertheless achieved an SVR24 (two in the BOC group and three in the TVR group).* indicates the causes of death in this cohort: four deaths from infection (two in each group) and two other causes as shown here. Safety
Premature discontinuations due to SAE occurred in 22 patients (27%); six (16%) and 16 (35%) patients in the BOC and TVR groups, respectively (P = 0.126) (Fig 2).
A high proportion of hematological events (95%) was observed to lead to treatment discontinuation in seven patients (8%) (Table 4). Twenty-five episodes of infection were reported in 23 patients (28%), affecting 11/36 (31%) and 12/45 (27%) patients receiving BOC and TVR, respectively (p = ns) (S1 Table). Thirteen patients (16%) discontinued their triple therapy because of an infection. Four independent factors were associated with the onset of infection (Table 5): patients with CH (OR = 5.9, 95%CI [1.1–33.9], P = 0.046), the use of cyclosporine (OR = 4.7, 95%CI [1.2–18.2], P = 0.025), a baseline eGFR <60mL/min (OR = 4.7, 95%CI [1.2–17.8], P = 0.023) and the occurrence of thrombocytopenia (platelet count <50G/L) during therapy (OR = 5.7, 95%CI [1.6–20.8], P = 0.008). Four patients (5%) died during the treatment as the result of an infectious episode (Table 5). One patient died from a subdural hematoma in the context of a trauma and one other patient committed suicide. 10.1371/journal.pone.0138091.t004

* As mentioned in the “Patients and methods” section, a serious adverse event was defined as an unexpected event occurring during treatment and giving rise to treatment discontinuation. The kinetics of eGFR during treatment is shown in Fig 3. The median decrease of eGFR was 7.68 mL/min with BOC and 8.53 mL/min with TVR (P = ns). Seven patients were hospitalized because of acute kidney failure, six of whom were receiving TVR. No CNI overdoses were observed and all patients recovered after a saline infusion. 10.1371/journal.pone.0138091.g003
Fig 3 Mean estimated glomerular filtration rates during triple therapy.
The median decrease of eGFR was 7.68mL/min with BOC and 8.53mL/min with TVR (P = ns). Seven patients were hospitalized because of acute kidney failure, six of whom were in the TVR group. No CNI overdoses were observed and all patients recovered after a saline infusion. Five (6%) dermatological events (grade 1) and 2 (3%) cases of decompensated diabetes mellitus were observed. The hospitalization rate during therapy was 44% (n = 36). Ten (12%) acute rejections (median BANFF score 3) were histologically proven in this cohort, six (17%) in the BOC group and four (9%) in the TVR group, respectively (median interval between the introduction of PI and BPAR of 16 W).
This study of a multicenter cohort reports for the first time on the efficacy with SVR24 results and on tolerance of anti-HCV therapies, including first generation PI, in difficult-to-treat patients after LT. This experience has provided us with several key elements that can guide treatment decisions and patient management during this therapy.In terms of efficacy, these findings have demonstrated that the combination of BOC or TVR with standard PEG-IFN and RBV therapy can add a benefit in terms of SVR24, the rate achieved being 47% when compared with the expected SVR rate of 30% under dual therapy [6]. These results should be considered in the context of this particular study population, which included a high proportion of patients with advanced fibrosis. Indeed, this cohort enrolled 54% of patients with fibrosis ≥F3 and nine patients with CH; moreover, 54% of patients had failed under previous dual anti-HCV therapy after LT. The higher rate of SVR24 achieved with PI-triple therapy (compared to historical reports) is consistent with the results reported by others with SVR12 [12,13,14,15]. The American Crush-C group recently reported an SVR12 rate of 63% (51/81) in a cohort of difficult-to-treat patients whose characteristics were similar to those in our cohort [13]. Interestingly, in our patients we observed a marked improvement in the clinical and biological parameters of patients with high bilirubin levels and high MELD scores at baseline. Among the 45 patients with a baseline bilirubin level >17μmol/L, we observed a stabilization or improvement in 88% of them. This improvement was particularly significant in CH and F4 patients, as their median MELD scores decreased in a statistically significant manner between baseline and EOT (P = 0.02 and P = 0.04, respectively).Predictive factors of virological clearance were also investigated in our series. To discuss the potential superiority of one of the two drugs is not appropriate here because the patients were not randomized and the choice of BOC or TVR by the investigators was mainly dependent on the accessibility of the two drugs under the French Temporary Authorization for Use system. Achieving an EVR (OR = 49.4, 95%CI [5.7–421.3], P<0.00001) was the strongest predictor of an SVR24. Burton et al. also found that achieving EVR is the best predictor of SVR12 using TVR after LT. Here in, we comfort this finding and confirm that this result could be applied to a population using BOC [13]. In the absence of a complete EVR, the chance of achieving an SVR24 was only 3%. In this context, we propose to redefine the stopping rules for triple therapy in transplant patients: if the viral load remains detectable at W12, treatment should be discontinued. Unsurprisingly, under univariate analysis, other factors known to negatively impact the response to treatment during dual therapy have been identified, including the status of the recipient with respect to IL28B, being overweight defined as a BMI>25, a null response to prior therapy and the fibrosis stage, mainly F4 patients and CH [5,6,20]. Indeed, we were able to confirm that hepatic impairment significantly decreased the chances of achieving an SVR. Both a bilirubin level <17μmol/L and an albumin level >35g/L were independent factors associated with an SVR (p = 0.014 and p = 0.037, respectively). Consequently, triple therapy should be proposed at an earlier stage of liver graft disease due to a recurrence of HCV. A starting dose of RBV ≥800mg/day was also an independent factor for an SVR24 (p = 0.003). These results argue in favor of introducing a full dose of RBV to ensure renal function, and using hematopoietic growth factors as first-line treatment for cytopenia in order to maintain the maximum tolerated dose of RBV [21]. If no premature discontinuation of treatment due to an SAE was necessary, this also was an independent predictor for an SVR24 (OR = 6.3, 95%CI [1.3–31.1], p = 0.02). The IS regimen impacts the treatment response rate because the use of cyclosporine and the avoidance of steroids were both associated with an SVR24 under univariate analysis (p = 0.01 and p = 0.04, respectively). One hypothesis is the potential antiviral effect of cyclosporine, as demonstrated in vitro [22]. Less significant drug-drug interactions between cyclosporine and CNI, enabling easier treatment management, might be another, more relevant, hypothesis [8,9,10].As well as offering findings on antiviral efficacy, our study has also provided comprehensive data on the tolerance of triple therapy with BOC and TVR. The poor tolerance of anti-HCV therapy may have serious consequences, such as premature discontinuation and exposure to severe or fatal events. We had already reported in an interim analysis that the most frequent adverse events were represented by anemia, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia [11]. A drop in hemoglobin levels to below 10g/dL was observed in 95% of patients, despite a reduction in the RBV dosage in 70% of the cohort, and the use of EPO in 94% of patients at an early stage (means: 7 W and 4 W, respectively). Forty percent of the patients required a transfusion (mean: 4.2 units per patient). We therefore strongly recommend introducing EPO at an early stage, even before the initiation of anti-HCV therapy if the patient experienced haematological toxicity during a previous course of antiviral therapy.Delaying the introduction of EPO exposes the patient to more profound anemia and a risk of premature treatment discontinuation. Neutropenia (<1G/L) and thrombocytopenia (<50G/L) are less common than anemia, but were more frequently observed in the TVR group than the BOC group in our study (P = 0.004 and P = 0.02, respectively). A reduction in the PEG-IFN dose was observed in 39% of patients, and the use of growth factors was infrequent (G-CSF: n = 15 (18%), Eltrombopag: n = 5 (6%)). Although it affected 95% of patients, cytopenia was not an obstacle to the pursuit of treatment and only 3% and 13% of patients stopped treatment for this reason in the BOC and TVR groups, respectively.A decrease in the eGFR during therapy (median decrease: 7.68 mL/min with BOC and 8.53 mL/min with TVR, P = ns) was observed [23]. There was no difference between the two groups, but a trend towards a higher re-hospitalization rate because of acute kidney failure in the TVR group than in the BOC group (6 versus 1; P = 0.23). The duration of impaired renal function did not exceed the duration of treatment, and the eGFR rose when the PI was withdrawn, and normalized after the discontinuation of PEG-IFN/RBV.The occurrence of episodes of infection affected a third of patients in our cohort. This major problem was the cause of death in four patients (5%). Not surprisingly, CH patients were six times more exposed to infectious episodes (p = 0.05). Prophylactic antibiotics should be investigated in this subgroup of patients before the initiation of anti-HCV therapy. A fall in the platelet count to <50G/L during therapy was an independent factor for both infectious episodes and SAE (p = 0.02 and p = 0.01, respectively). Thrombocytopenia has recently been shown to be associated with a poorer tolerance of IFN-based anti-HCV therapy in severe, non-transplant patients [24]. The use of Eltrombopag has been shown to increase the platelet count in thrombocytopenic patients with HCV and advanced diseases, leading to significantly higher SVR rates [25]. Taken together, these data argue for the use of platelet growth factors during therapy, and most importantly a significant drop in the platelet count should alert physicians to an increased risk of SAE or infections. A strict monitoring of portal flow should be ensured during the treatment, especially in patients with portal hypertension.Despite the feasibility of the using such drugs, and the improvement in efficacy achieved when compared to an historical cohort in the liver transplant setting, safety profile of these regimens limits their application given the rapidly evolving field of HCV therapy. Several second generation DAA have now been approved, and preliminary reports in non-transplant patients have shown their remarkable efficacy and, most importantly, their good safety profile [26]. In a prospective, multicenter, open-label pilot study enrolling 40 liver transplant patients, a combination of sofosbuvir and RBV was able to achieve an SVR12 in 70% of patients. The most common adverse events were fatigue (30%), diarrhea (28%), and headache (25%). In addition, 20% of the subjects experienced anemia [27]. The real highlight of these second generation DAA is that their combination enables treatment without the need to use PEG-IFN, and possibly RBV [28,29]. However, data in the liver transplant setting remain limited.Although our study offers some key messages regarding the use of first generation PI in liver transplant patients, it is likely that in the near future this strategy will be outdated western countries. Three important points need to be stressed regarding future practice. Firstly, some countries have access to these treatments and still use them. This study is the only one to have provided predictive factors for SVR24 in transplanted patients treated with triple therapy. Our data argue in favor of initiating treatment during the early stages of HCV recurrence with a full dose of PEG-IFN/RBV. The risk-benefit balance advocates for discontinuing treatment when an EVR is not achieved. Secondly, although a satisfactory safety profile is likely using IFN-free regimens, RBV continues to be used, mainly in difficult-to-treat patients. Our findings argue in favor of initiating early hematological growth factor therapy in order to avoid dose reduction or treatment discontinuation. Finally, some DAA (simeprevir, daclatasvir ombitasvir, dasabuvir, asunaprevir) are also metabolized by CYP3A4. First-generation triple therapies have raised awareness to drug-drug interactions in the setting of HCV therapy. Although weaker with second-generation treatments, they remain an issue with some regimens, especially when second-generation protease inhibitors are used [30,31]. In patients with a severe recurrence, the cautious use of certain DAA is warranted in the event of hepatic impairment [32].To conclude, triple therapies are now being widely used, given their performance in terms of efficacy when compared to previous dual therapy. Nevertheless, their safety profile, specifically in difficult-to-treat patients, remains poor. In light of these findings, we believe that caution is of the essence regarding the approval of second generation DAA."
