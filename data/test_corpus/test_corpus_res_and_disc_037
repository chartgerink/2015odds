"Group 1 (Chronic Hepatitis C) Two hundred and sixty eight patients were included. Patient profiles are shown in Table 1. Most patients were men (59.3%). All patients were Caucasian, mostly Spaniards. One hundred and seven (39.9%) carried the rs12979860CC homozygous genotype, whereas the remaining 161 were homo- (33 patients, 12.3%) or heterozygotes (128 patients, 47.8%) for the T allele. The studied polymorphism was in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. 10.1371/journal.pone.0037998.t001Table 1 Analysis of biochemical and virological parameters in relation with the rs12979860 genotype in 268 patients with chronic hepatitis C.

Biochemical baseline data that showed differences at a p value <0.05 when comparing carriers of the rs12979860CC genotype with carriers of the rs12979860CT/TT genotypes were ALT (0.012), AST/ALT ratio (p = 0.002), GGT (p<0.001), and serum cholesterol (p = 0.022). In the multivariate analysis only lower values for GGT (p<0.001) and higher values for ALT (p = 0.001) were related with the 12979860CC genotype. (Table 1) Necroinflammatory grade and fibrosis stage were not related with the rs12979860 genotype.

Liver steatosis was present in a greater percentage of carriers of the T allele than in CC homozygotes (44.0% vs. 30.8%, Odds ratio = 1.764, 95% C.I. = 1.053–2.955) and there was a significant trend towards higher grades of steatosis in carriers of the T allele (Chi2 for trend = 4.946, P = 0.026). (Table 2). When the analysis was restricted to patients infected by HCV genotype 1, similar results were obtained (45.1% vs. 32.9%, Odds ratio = 1.618, 95% C.I. = 0.925–2.834, and Chi2 for trend = 3.934, P = 0.047). METAVIR necroinflammatory grade was significantly correlated at a P<0.001 for Spearman’s rho test with serum ALT (alanine amino transferase) and GGT values, but not with the remaining biochemical variables included in the analysis. METAVIR fibrosis stage correlated at the same level of significance with the inverse of platelet count and with serum AST (aspartate amino transferase), ALT, GGT and ferritin values. Group 2 (HCV-related Hepatocellular Carcinoma) One hundred and thirty four patients (97 males, mean age at diagnosis 67.4 years, SD 9.4, range 41–88) were included in this group. All were white Spaniards. The diagnosis of HCC was based on the pathological exam of surgical biopsy or cytological aspirate in 73 patients, and according with current imaging criteria [30] in the remaining 61. All patients in this group had detectable titers of anti-HCV antibodies in serum. Only two patients had been previously treated with interferon-ribavirin before developing HCC. Fifty two patients (38.8%) carried the rs12979860CC homozygous genotype, whereas the remaining 82 were homo- (16 patients, 11.9%) or heterozygotes (66 patients, 49.3%) for the T allele. (Table 3). 10.1371/journal.pone.0037998.t003Table 3 Distribution of the IL28B gene rs12979860 genotype in untreated patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) and in patients with HCV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

The distribution of the analyzed SNP was very similar as comparing these patients with moderate drinkers or teetotallers (P>0.80 for each comparison, data not shown). Comparative Analysis of HCV-infected Patients with and without HCC To evaluate the possible relation between the analyzed IL28B SNP and the stage of the HCV-induced liver disease, the CHC patients in the chronic hepatitis group who had not received antiviral therapy after performing the liver biopsy were compared with the group of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. No significant differences were found between both groups in the distribution of the studied IL28B gene SNP (Table 3). The relation between genetic polymorphisms in the vicinity of the IL28 gene and the response to pegylated interferon and ribavirin combined therapy for hepatitis C has been clearly demonstrated since the rs12979860 SNP was identified. Several GWAS studies independently disclosed that the possession of any of the homozygous genotypes rs12979860CC or rs8099917TT, which are in strong linkage disequilibrium, greatly increases the probability to obtain sustained viral response after antiviral treatment. [11]–[13], [16], [22]–[28].However, information on the possible influence of these polymorphisms on the course of hepatitis C infection is presently very limited and incomplete. It has been shown that the carriers of the favourable genotypes have a higher rate of spontaneous clearance of HCV during the acute phase of the infection [19]–[21]. In this study we have shown that GGT levels are lower in patients with chronic hepatitis C that carry the rs12979860CC genotype than in homo- or heterozygotes for the T mutated allele. Abe et al. [29], in a cohort of 364 adult Japanese patients with chronic HCV infection, reported a similar and highly significant (p = 0.001) association between the rs8099917TT genotype and GGT lower values, a link that could be explained because both traits are predictive of a favourable response to therapy.In addition, we have found that rs12979860CC genotype is associated with higher serum ALT than the remaining genotypes, a finding that is in agreement with data of Thompson et al. [35] obtained from a GWAS study that disclosed that only the rs12979860 SNP was significantly associated with baseline ALT levels. Serum ALT is considered as a marker of necroinflammatory activity in the liver as confirms the analysis of our data that shows a linear increase of ALT levels related to METAVIR activity score. These findings are contradictory with those reported by Abe et al. [29] who found that ALT and AST levels were lower in carrier of the rs8099917TT genotype, although these authors do not provide the level of significance for this association.However, our results do not confirm the suggested relation between the IL28B gene polymorphism and the histological necroinflammatory activity reported by Abe et al. [29] and Thompson et al. [35]. Most patients included in the present study were infected with HCV genotype 1. Hence, we have not been able to confirm the interesting results reported by Bochud et al. [36] linking the rs8099917G allele, that is associated with poor response to therapy, with lower necroinflammatory activity (p = 0.04) and milder fibrosis (p = 0.02) in patients infected with non-1 HCV genotypes.The relation between IL28B polymorphism and the stage of fibrosis is controversial. Abe et al. [29] found higher fibrosis METAVIR scores among carriers of the rs8099917TT genotype. However, Di Marco et al. [37] in a group of 131 patients with thalassemia major and chronic HCV infection who underwent a liver biopsy reported that older age and the carrier state of the minor alleles at rs12979860 and rs8099917 sites were associated with more severe liver fibrosis (p<0.001 and p<0.005, respectively). Falleti et al. [38] in a group of 629 HCV-positive patients, disclosed that subjects with the rs12979860TT homozygous genotype had a mean fibrosis score higher than the remaining CC or CT genotypes (p< 0.05). Nevertheless, Thompson et al. [39] reported that the rs12979860 polymorphism was not associated with advanced hepatic fibrosis in CHC, a finding that is in agreement with our results that are far from the statistical significance for the determined SNP.Fabris et al. [40] analysed the distribution of rs12979860 C and T alleles in a miscellaneous group of Italian patients with chronic liver diseases, most HCV-related, including patients with mild hepatitis (Ishak staging score ≤ 2), cirrhosis and HCC. They concluded that the T allele is more prevalent in HCV-induced cirrhosis than in cirrhosis from other causes (p<0.005) but not when comparing HCV-induced cirrhosis with milder hepatitis C (p = 0.09).Hepatic steatosis is a frequent finding in chronic hepatitis C, as a probable consequence of a disturbance of lipid metabolism [41]. Our study shows that steatosis is significantly more frequent in CHC patients carrying the mutated T allele, in agreement with two previous studies. Tillmann et al [42] analysed two independent cohorts of patients with a global size of 325 patients with chronic hepatitis C; steatosis was present in 28 of 88 rs12979860CC genotype patients (31.8%) and in 139 of 237 patients carrying the rs12979860T allele (58.6%). These differences were highly significant when each group was analysed separately (as did the authors) or when considering them as a unique group (Odds ratio = 3.04, 95% C.I. = 1.81–5.10). In the second study [43] that included 153 Japanese patients, the analysis of the rs8099917 genotype yielded similar results. A new aspect disclosed in our study is that steatosis is not only more frequent, but also more severe in patients carrying the mutated T allele.Hepatocellular carcinoma (CHC) represents the most advanced step in the natural course of chronic hepatitis C infection that fortunately is reached only by a minority of patients. If the hypothesis of the existence of any relationship between the IL28B genetic polymorphism and the severity of HCV-induced liver disease holds true, the most logical finding should be the existence of differences in the genotype frequencies among the different stages of the disease. We have found no differences in the frequencies of the IL28B genotypes as comparing a group of HCV-induced HCC patients with a group of 98 untreated patients with CHC. Our results are coincidental with those reported by other groups, both in Caucasian [36] and in Japanese [44], [45] populations. However, Asahina et al. [46] reported that carriers of the rs8099917 TT genotype had a higher rate of sustained viral response to interferon-based therapy (as expected) and that this genotype was associated with a lower incidence of HCC, both in sustained viral responders and in non-responders. A direct effect of the IL28B polymorphism on the risk of HCC may not be inferred from these results, as SVR clearly improves the natural course of chronic HCV infection [47], [48] and, among non-responders, the effect of the IL28B polymorphism was indirect and associated with slightly lower levels of ALT and alpha-feto protein. Eurich et al. [49], in a study of patients who received a liver graft due to severe HCV-induced liver disease, found that the 12979860TT genotype was more frequent in the 61 patients with HCC on the explanted liver than in the 106 patients without HCC (p = 0.041), suggesting that the major C allele plays a protective role against the development of HCC. In addition, Ren et al. [50] found that the rs12979860 T allele was related to the susceptibility of both chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and HBV-related HCC in a group of Chinese patients. Thus, controversy remains about the possible relation between the IL28B gene polymorphism and the risk of developing HCC.We conclude that the IL28B rs12979860CC genotype in patients with chronic hepatitis C is related with higher serum ALT, that is considered as a marker of hepatic necroinflammation, and with lower values of GGT, which increase is a surrogate marker of liver fibrosis and a negative predictive factor of response to therapy [51]. In addition, the carrier state of the rs12979860 T allele is associated with greater frequency and severity of hepatic steatosis in chronic hepatitis C. However, we have not found any relation among this polymorphism and necroinflammatory grade and fibrosis stage directly shown by the liver biopsy, neither with the risk of developing HCV-related hepatocellular carcinoma."
