"SNPs in IL-28B affect vaccine responses in organ transplant recipients Transplant recipients carrying the minor-allele of IL-28B have increased seroconversion following influenza vaccination
We obtained blood samples from a cohort of transplant recipients (n = 196) on maintenance immunosuppression that were originally recruited as part of a randomized controlled trial of intradermal versus intramuscular influenza vaccination [28]. Patient demographics are shown in S1 Table. Patients were genotyped for IL-28B SNPs (rs8099917 and rs12979860) and the genotypic distribution is shown in S2 Table and was in equilibrium with general population distribution [24]–[27].
We found that minor-allele carriers for the SNP rs8099917 (TG or GG) were significantly more likely to undergo seroconversion to at least one antigen of the influenza vaccine (OR 1.99, 95% CI 1.07–3.69; Fig. 1A). This effect was even higher in a homozygous minor-allele genotype, where the GG-genotype resulted in a seroconversion rate of 85.7% (Fig. 1B). S1A–C Figure shows that the HAI geometric mean titers for pH1N1, H3N2 and Influenza B before and after vaccination are higher in TG or GG (minor allele carriers) versus TT (major allele carriers). For pH1N1, the post-vaccine geometric mean titers of patients with the TT genotype were 66.2, for TG 93.8, and for GG 113.2. The median fold changes from pre- to post-vaccine were 2-fold in TT genotypes, 3-fold in TG and 4-fold in GG. For H3N2, the post-vaccine geometric mean titers of patients with the TT genotype were 44.5, for TG 56.6, and for GG 80.0. The median fold changes from pre- to post-vaccine were 2-fold in TT genotypes, 2-fold in TG and 4-fold in GG. For Influenza B, the post-vaccine geometric mean titers of patients with the TT genotype were 31.9, for TG 43.1, and for GG 60.5. The median fold changes pre- to post-vaccine were 1-fold in TT genotypes, 1-fold in TG and 1.5-fold in GG (S1A–C Figure). The immunosuppressive drug dosages were not significantly different between the genotypic groups (S1 Table). This response was primarily driven by seroconversion to influenza A/H1N1 and H3N2 (S3 Table).

(D) Percent seroprotection to at least one influenza strain antigen in T/T (major) versus T/G or G/G (minor) IL-28B SNP in transplant recipients (rs8099917).

(G) Analysis of H1N1-stimulated Th1 cytokine release in transplant recipients with seroconversion against H1N1 Influenza from post–vaccine samples stratified according to IL-28B minor or major-allele genotypes. The rs8099917 TT (major allele, n = 7) compared to non-TT (minor allele, n = 7) genotypes are shown. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were stimulated overnight with inactivated Influenza A/H1N1 (0.3 µg/mL hemagglutinin). The expression profile of 17 cytokines was determined using a luminex-based platform. Key representative Th1 cytokines are shown. Mann Whitney U (MWU)-test determined statistically significant differences between groups; bars show median values (C–F). For some individuals the cytokine values were below the limit of detection and thus were given values of the lowest value in the linear range of the assay. (H) Frequency of post-vaccine H1N1-specific Interleukin (IL)-4 producing CD4+ T-cells in transplant recipients with seroconversion according to IL-28B genotype (rs8099917, n = 7 each). For flow cytometry gating strategy see S4 Figure. In PBMCs with a TT genotype 28.6% showed a >2-fold increase from unstimulated samples vs. H1N1 stimulated samples. In PBMCs with a no-TT genotype 85.7% showed a >2-fold increase from unstimulated samples vs. H1N1 stimulated samples (p = 0.031). (I) HLA-DR surface expression (mean fluorescent intensity (MFI)) on H1N1-stimulated naïve B-cells (CD20+CD27−) in transplant recipients stratified according to the IL-28B genotype (rs8099917) for only those who seroconverted. PBMCs were stimulated with inactivated H1N1 influenza overnight. Baseline values represent non-antigen controls. The association between genotype and seroconversion was most pronounced in patients receiving comparatively more potent immunosuppressive therapy (i.e., those patients receiving ≥2 g daily dose mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)). In this group, minor-allele carriers for SNP rs8099917 showed markedly higher seroconversion rates (OR 7, 95% CI 2.3–21.5; p<0.0001; n = 80; Fig. 1C).
When analysing seroprotection to at least one antigen, both the baseline and post-vaccination seroprotection rates were high (71.2% for prevaccination and 88.2% post-vaccine seroprotection to at least one antigen). No significant differences were seen between genotypes likely due to the high rate of baseline seroprotection to at least one antigen (Fig. 1D–F). To allow for better interpretation of seroprotection date we analysed seroprotection to at least two vaccine antigens as an outcome. In this analysis, the minor allele group (for rs8099917) had a trend towards greater seroprotection (p = 0.062). In the subgroup of patients receiving MMF≥2 g daily, seroprotection to at least two antigens was significantly greater in the minor allele carriers (p = 0.038) (S1D–F Figure).
No statistically significant difference in vaccine response was evident for the SNP rs12979860 (S4 Table). Therefore, the remaining experiments were performed focusing on the SNP rs8099917. Seroconversion in transplant recipients, the balance of Th1/Th2 cytokine release and B-cell activation is modulated by IL-28B
We next determined whether the IL-28B SNP (rs8099917 TT versus TG/GG) exerted distinct effects on T- and B-cell activation within the transplant patient cohort. In a subset of vaccine recipients (n = 47), we obtained peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) both pre- and post-vaccination and stimulated them with the same inactivated influenza A/H1N1 virus as contained in the vaccine. Of these, 16 (34%) seroconverted using the HAI assay after vaccination. In the subgroup that seroconverted, cytokine profiling of H1N1-stimulated PBMCs post-vaccination showed that Th1-cytokines and associated chemokines, such as IFN-α, interleukin (IL)-2, IL-6, and IFN-γ induced protein (IP)-10, were expressed at significantly lower levels in minor-allele genotype patients (rs8099917, TG and GG; Fig. 1G). S5 Table provides a comparison of post-vaccination cytokine release dependent on genotype independent of seroconversion. A heat map and principal component analysis (PCA) including all samples indicated that pre- and post-vaccine samples had significant differences in Th1/Th2 cytokine expression according to the IL-28B genotypes (TT versus TG/GG). For example IL-5 was relatively 2.9-fold higher expressed in minor-allele carriers, whereas IL-2 was relatively 4.3-fold less expressed in minor-allele carriers. The comparison of the cytokine expression profiles related to seroconversion status and genotype demonstrate that minor-allele carriers have a markedly lower Th1- compared to a higher Th2-response. This shift is even further increased in post-vaccine samples (S1G Figure). The differences in expression dynamics of cytokines and clustering according to genotypes are highlighted also in a two-dimensional PCA (S1H–I Figure). In addition, minor-allele transplant patients (TG/GG) with H1N1-seroconversion had significantly higher frequencies of H1N1-stimulated IL-4-producing CD3+CD4+ T-cells compared to major-allele genotype patients (TT) in post-vaccine samples (p = 0.007, Fig. 1H). These data indicate that minor-allele carriers have significantly lower H1N1-stimulated Th1- but higher Th2 cytokine release compared to major-allele carriers.
We also studied B-cell phenotypes in the context of the rs8099917 IL-28B genotype because a major protective outcome of influenza vaccination is activation of antibody producing B cells. Most strikingly, minor-allele carriers with seroconversion had significantly higher expression of H1N1-induced HLA-DR expression compared to major-allele carriers (Fig. 1I, TG/GG versus TT). Recombinant IL-28B decreases influenza induced early Th2 cytokine production, B cell proliferation and IgG production
Since previous studies had indicated that minor allele carries expressed lower levels of IL-28B [25], [29]–[33], we hypothesized that adding exogenous recombinant IL-28B to PBMCs should mimic the major-allele phenotype (TT), i.e. increase Th1- and decrease Th2-responses. First, we measured the in vitro effect of IL-28B on early cytokine-production by H1N1-stimulated PBMCs from transplant recipients using overnight stimulation assays. In samples pre-treated with IL-28B, we observed a significant increase in H1N1-stimulated Th1-cytokine expression (IFN-γ, IL6; Fig. 2A, S6 Table). In concordance with our previous findings, pre-treatment of transplant recipients' PBMCs with IL-28B prior to H1N1-stimulation led to a >2-fold reduction in IL-4 production by CD3+CD4+ T-cells (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, the effect was particularly pronounced in patients with a minor allele genotype (TG or GG) (S2 Figure). Further, in transplant recipients, we showed that recombinant IL-28B significantly decreased H1N1-induced IgG production (p = 0.004) (Fig. 2C).

(A) Analysis of H1N1-stimulated Th1 cytokine release in transplant recipients (n = 36) from post–vaccine samples in relation to IL-28B pre-treatment. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were pre-treated with recombinant IL-28B (100 ng/mL) for two hours prior to overnight stimulation with inactivated Influenza A H1N1 (0.3 µg/mL hemagglutinin). The expression profile of 17 cytokines was determined using a luminex-based platform. Key representative Th1 cytokines are shown. Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank (WCR)-test determined statistically significant differences between groups. Before-after plots are shown where each dot is a different patient. (B) PBMCs from transplant recipients were pre-treated with recombinant IL-28B (100 ng/mL) for two hours prior to overnight stimulation. Frequencies of H1N1-specific IL-4-producing CD4+ T-cells were measured by intracellular flow cytometry as described in Methods. Data from 47 transplant recipients are shown in PBMC collected pre- and post-vaccine. (C) PBMCs from transplant (Tx) recipients were pre-treated with recombinant IL-28B (100 ng/mL) for two hours prior to 5-day stimulation with H1N1. The production of H1N1-induced IgG is shown according to pre-treatment groups. Data from 38 transplant recipients are shown. Healthy volunteer studies SNP in IL-28B (rs8099917) is associated with lower mRNA expression of IL-28B in H1N1 stimulated PBMCs from healthy volunteers
In addition to examination of the effect of IL-28B in our transplant patient cohort, we also wanted to confirm our findings in a non-immunosuppressed cohort and to explore manipulation of the IL-28B system using healthy volunteer cells. We therefore examined the association between the IL-28B genotype (rs8099917) and H1N1-stimulated expression of IL-28B in a cohort of healthy volunteers (HV, n = 28 TT-genotype, n = 21 non-TT genotype). We determined the relative expression of IL-28A, IL-28B, and IL-29 mRNA in PBMCs stimulated with influenza A/H1N1. rs8099917 minor-allele carriers had significantly reduced mRNA-expression of IL-28B whereas IL-28A and IL-29 were not affected (p = 0.0006; Fig. 3A). Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) have recently been shown to be one of the major producers of IL-28B [34]–[36]. The frequencies of pDCs were comparable between major- and minor-allele groups in the recruited HVs (major-allele carriers 0.39% vs. minor-allele carriers 0.45%; p = 0.713), suggesting that the changes in expression were not due to frequency differences. Second and very important, in a subset of PBMCs from healthy volunteers (n = 25), we pre-treated immune cells with the immunosuppressive drug mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). We found no difference in IFN-λ expression profiles at various concentrations of MMF (Fig. 3B). This suggests that the impact of the genotype is an independent factor associated with influenza-induced IFN-λ gene expression.

The minor-allele IL-28B genotype is associated with significantly lower expression of IL-28B, but not IL-29 or IL-28A mRNA in healthy volunteers.
(A) PBMCs from healthy volunteers were stimulated for six-hours with H1N1. mRNA-expression of IL-28A, IL-28B and IL-29 were normalized to non-stimulated controls and HPRT expression. Major (rs8099917 TT, n = 28) compared to minor (rs8099917 non-TT, n = 21) allele genotype. MWU-test determined statistically significant differences between groups. Bars show median values with interquartile range. (B) PBMCs from healthy volunteers (n = 25) were pre-treated with mycophenolate mofetil for 2 h prior to stimulated for six-hours with H1N1. mRNA-expression of IL-28A, IL-28B and IL-29 and statistical analysis were performed using the Kruskal Wallis (KW) test. IL-28B decreases late Th2 cytokines, B cell proliferation, and IgG production in healthy volunteers
Since MMF may influence Th-2 cytokines and B-cell responses, we measured the in vitro effect of IL-28B on late cytokine-production by PBMCs from HVs using a 5-day stimulation assay (n = 9). The 5-day stimulatory assay allowed for the secretion of Th2 cytokines that are expressed late during the stimulation. We observed a significant decrease in the production of cytokines trophic for B-cells such as GRO, Fractalkine, and Th2-cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, and IL-13) (Fig. 4A and S7 Table). An independently recruited cohort of HVs confirmed the key findings of Th1 and Th1-associated cytokines being significantly up-regulated (IFN-α, IL12p40, TNF- α, and IL-6) at early time-points after stimulation. IFN-γ showed a trend for upregulation. In contrast, Th2 and Th2-associated cytokines were down-regulated at later time-points (S3 Figure).

(A–D) PBMCs from healthy volunteers were pre-treated with 1 ng/mL, 10 ng/mL, or 100 ng/mL rIL-28B for two hours prior to 5-day (A–C) or 7-day (D) stimulation with H1N1. Kruskal Wallis-test was used to determine statistically significant differences. (A) Cytokine profile after stimulation with H1N1 according to pre-treatment groups (n = 9). (B) B-cell proliferation was quantified using Cell Trace Violet proliferation dye staining. CD20 and CD27 served as cell-type and memory markers, respectively (n = 6). (C) Total amount of IgG in supernatants in an independent cohort of HVs was determined using by ELISA (n = 8). (D) The amount of H1N1- and HA-H1N1-specific IgG in supernatant was determined by ELISA (n = 9, and n = 8 (1 donor did not produce HA-specific IgG) respectively). The reduction of pre-to-post-treated PBMCs was calculated. We then investigated the effects of IL-28B on H1N1-stimulated B-cell proliferation and antibody production. IL-28B pre-treated PBMCs from non-immunosuppressed HVs (n = 6) showed a dose-dependent decrease of H1N1-stimulated B-cell proliferation. In particular memory B-cells exhibited a 70% reduction in proliferation capacity (Fig. 4B). This impairment of proliferation was also reflected in a 70% lower H1N1-stimulated IgG antibody production at the highest dose of IL-28B added (Fig. 4C). We also examined virus-specific antibody production against purified H1N1 hemagglutinin and against the whole virions; these were significantly decreased with a median 57% and 79% reduction at the highest dose of IL-28B added, respectively (Fig. 4D). Taken together, we demonstrate that IL-28B is a potent inhibitor of virus-stimulated B-cell activation and antibody production independent of immunosuppression. Based on live/dead staining, the inhibitory effects were not due to toxicity (median % dead cells IL-28B 0 ng/mL: 19.2%; 1 ng/mL: 19.9%; 10 ng/mL: 23.6%; 100 ng/mL: 22.6%; p = 0.92). Antagonistic peptides to IL28RA promote greater influenza induced antibody production
The above findings are highly suggestive of IL-28B possessing a strong immunoregulatory influence on the balance between Th1 and Th2 immune responses, which is in agreement with previous in vitro studies for IL-29 [18]–[21], [37], [38]. In turn, this could considerably influence B-cell functions in vivo. There are no published crystal structures for IL-28B [39], thus we initially generated a model of the interaction between IL-29 and the IL28-receptor alpha subunit (IL28RA), and then designed peptides based on the known homologies between the different IFN-λs [29]. Peptides with lengths of 14–20 aa were generated to inhibit potential sites of interaction between the ligand and receptor considering close proximity and side-chain interactions (Fig. 5A–B, S5A–B Figure, and S8 Table).

Colored fragments represent proposed sites of significant interaction using a proximity model. (B) Example for detailed in silico interaction between peptide 6 and IL-28Rα (peptides 9 and 11). (C) Inhibitory activity of antagonistic peptide 1 against IL-28B binding to IL28RA. ELISA was used to measure the binding of a fixed concentration of IL-28B (100 ng/mL) to IL28RA challenged by increasing concentrations of the inhibitory peptide and control peptide (scrambled version). The data shown is representative of three independently repeated experiments. Whiskers indicate the interquartile range. (D) STAT1 phosphorylation in THP1-derived macrophages treated with peptide 1 and challenged with recombinant IL-28B (100 ng/mL) for 15 min in comparison to scramble peptide control. Data of five individual experiments is shown. Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank (WCR)-test was used. (E) STAT1 phosphorylation in THP1-derived macrophages treated with different doses of peptide 1 and challenged with recombinant IL-28B (100 ng/mL) for 15 min in comparison to scramble peptide 1 control. Symbols represent median of three independently repeated experiments. (F) PBMCs from healthy volunteers were pre-treated with peptides for two hours prior to 5-day stimulation with H1N1. In addition recombinant IL-28B (28B) and control peptides (c1, SV40-based peptide; c2, a duck hepatitis B virus based peptide, and various scrambled versions of the peptides) were used. Total IgG in supernatant was determined using an ELISA and fold changes are shown calculated over peptide treatment alone (no H1N1). MWU-test determined statistically significant differences between groups, p<0.05(*). Bars show median and inter-quartile ranges; whiskers indicate 10–90th percentile. (G–H) PBMCs from transplant recipients without successful seroconversion were pre-treated with the IL-28Rα antagonistic peptides (6, 16 and 17) prior to overnight stimulation with H1N1. The mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of CD86, HLA-DR, and CD69 on B-cells (CD20+) was measured using flow cytometry (G). The amount of H1N1-stimulated IgG release was determined by ELISA (H). Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank (WCR)-test determined statistically significant differences between groups. Antagonistic peptides (10 µM) significantly reduced the binding of IL-28B to IL28RA using a competition ELISA assay (S5C Figure). Most of the scramble control peptides did not show a specific antagonistic effect (S5D Figure), however for some unspecific blocking effect could be observed, likely due to the charged nature of the peptide. Of note, the scrambled versions always showed a much lower inhibitory potential compared to the antagonistic peptides.
Antagonistic peptide 1 reduced the binding of IL-28B to IL28RA by 71%, but the scramble version did not block binding at all. Therefore, we explored the blocking capacity of peptide 1 in more detail using an ELISA competition assay with increasing concentrations of antagonistic and scramble peptide control compared to a consistent concentration of IL-28B. We observed a potent specific dose dependent inhibitory blocking effect (Fig. 5C).
The successful interaction between IL28RA, IL10RB and an IFN-λ ligand leads to an immediate phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2. Therefore, we used a functional assay based on THP1-derived macrophages to screen the impact of IL28RA blockade on STAT1 phosphorylation. Due to the higher IL28RA expression, THP1-derived macrophages served as an ideal screening model for our designed antagonistic peptides. In our flow cytometry assay, STAT1 phosphorylation peaked in THP1-derived macrophages 15 minutes after IFN-λ and IFN-α stimulation (S5E Figure). We examined the phosphorylation of STAT-1 induced by IL-28B in the presence and absence of the antagonistic peptide “peptide 1”. Treatment with blocking peptide 1 showed a significant reduction in STAT1-phosphorylation upon challenge with IL-28B compared to a scramble peptide control (Fig. 5D). A dose dependent effect of antagonistic peptide 1 on IL-28B-induced STAT phosphorylation could be shown with increasing concentrations (Fig. 5E) in a range similar to that of the ELISA competition assay. This indicates that the peptide not only off-competes the binding to the IL28RA, but also reduces the functional interaction and down-stream signalling of the whole IL28RA/IL10RB/IFN ligand complex. In vitro effect of Peptides
We next examined the potential of the peptides to reverse the inhibitory effects of IL-28B signalling on H1N1-stimulated B-cells. We screened all the peptides for their ability to enhance antibody production. PBMCs from HVs pre-treated with an antagonistic cocktail of peptides 6, 16 and 17 showed a significant increase in H1N1-induced IgG production after a five-day stimulation compared to peptide controls (Fig. 5F). Peptides 1, 15 and 18 also showed a strong trend for higher H1N1-induced IgG secretion. Next, we wanted to explore if the effects observed were specifically enhancing H1N1 stimulated IgG production. We tested a broad array of eight different control peptides for their potential to induce changes in the IgG secretion in an expansion protocol. We added fresh peptides twice during the expansion protocol to maximize a potential effect. For various individual IL28RA antagonistic peptides and peptide combinations, the fold change in IgG production was greater than for their respective control peptides. Figure S6 provides results on additional non-functional peptide controls (S6 Figure). This clearly indicates that the increase of H1N1 stimulated IgG production due to the antagonistic peptides is relevant.
Next, we used PBMCs from transplant recipients who had not seroconverted against H1N1-influenza. A combination of peptides 6, 16, and 17 prior to H1N1-stimulation increased the expression of the H1N1-stimulated B-cell activation markers CD86, HLA-DR and CD69 (Fig. 5G) and significantly increased H1N1-stimulated IgG production by 38% compared to peptide controls (median no peptides 226 pg/mL vs peptides 313 pg/mL; Fig. 5H).
We have determined in an immunocompromised transplant population that the presence of the rs8099917 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP; TG or GG) in the IL-28B gene significantly increases the likelihood of seroconversion to an influenza vaccine especially in those people on high doses of immunosuppression. We also showed that IL-28B affects Th2 and B-cell responses in the context of influenza stimulation. Other important factors associated with B-cell functions such as T-follicular helper cells and IL-21 [40] were not studied.IL-28B (IFN-λ3) belongs to the family of IFN-lambdas and shares antiviral properties similar to IFN-α via induction of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) such as MX1 or OAS1 [41]. In addition, IL-28B has been shown to induce IL-12 production in monocytes and macrophages. IL-12 is a key cytokine for the induction of Th1 cells and cytotoxic lymphocytes [42], [43]. SNPs in the IL-28B gene (minor-allele genotypes) have been associated with reduced IL-28B expression [25], [29]–[33], which could impact adaptive immune functions during vaccination. One limitation of our study is that we did not measure serum levels of IL-28B. To the best of our knowledge, no reliable ELISA assay is currently available, which can differentiate between the high sequence homology of IL-28A and IL-28B [44]. In addition, since our study only evaluates patients 30 days post-vaccination, we may not capture the peak of IL-28B secretion. Approximately 40% of Caucasians and 10% of Asian populations carry IL-28B minor-allele genotypes [27]. SNPs in IL-28B have been best studied in the context of response to Hepatitis C therapy. Minor-allele genotypes in IFN-λ signalling have been associated with reduced sustained virologic response of hepatitis C virus (HCV) following IFN-α treatment [24]–[27]. In contrast patients with a IL-28B minor-allele genotype and also at high-risk for primary infection with Cytomegalovirus, had lower frequencies and shorter episodes of primary CMV replication [29], [45]. Patients with minor-allele genotypes of IL-28B showed lower expression of IFN-λ during HCV infection in liver biopsies [25], [30] and during stimulation of PBMCs with CMV [29].Previous studies have shown that vaccine responses may be influenced by SNPs in interleukin genes. For example, hepatitis B vaccine responses may be influenced by SNPs in the IL-4 gene [46]. SNPs in interleukin genes may also affect humoral and cellular responses to the measles vaccine [47]. In a large cohort of children vaccinated against measles, the rs10853727 SNP in the IL-28B promoter was strongly associated with post-vaccine titers. The major-allele genotype (AA) showed significantly lower measles antibody titers compared to the minor-allele genotypes (AG and GG; median 807 vs. 1004, and 1727 mIU/mL, respectively; p = 0.021) [47].The effects of SNPs on vaccine responses in the general population may be demonstrated through large-scale genome-wide association studies. However, an immunosuppressed cohort with poor adaptive immunity can be ideal to demonstrate immunogenetic differences in vaccine responses.We found that the association of the IL-28B SNP with influenza vaccine seroconversion and seroprotection (to at least two vaccine antigens) was even more significant in transplant patients on high doses of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). MMF is well known to significantly suppress influenza vaccine responses [28], [48] by having an effect on virus-specific Th2 cytokines [49] and on B-cell activation markers, and seroconversion rates [28]. The minor-allele genotype in patients treated with more than two grams MMF per day demonstrated significantly higher seroconversion rates – essentially acting similar to a “rescue” mutation. We speculate that major-allele carrier status with high IL-28B expression in addition to receiving high-dose MMF therapy leads to a “double hit phenomenon” on Th2 responses. As a limitation of our work, we recruited healthy volunteers over multiple months, therefore the numbers within various experiments are variable and some intra-individual variation may be present.We also determined that the IL-28B rs8099917 SNP affected not only humoral responses to the influenza vaccine but also had a potent effect on cellular responses by modulating the Th1/Th2 cytokine balance. We show that the IL-28B minor-allele genotype is characterized by a predominant Th2-response upon stimulation with H1N1-influenza virus, and is associated with increased B-cell activation (HLA-DR, CD86) and function (IgG production). Although we did not measure H1N1-specific IgG in transplant patients, we do show in healthy volunteers that virus-specific IgG decreases upon pre-treatment with IL-28B in vitro at similar inhibition levels. Furthermore, exogenous treatment with IL-28B simulated a major-allele phenotype with significantly reduced Th2 cytokine expression. In PBMCs from healthy volunteers, this phenomenon was independent of MMF treatment. Our findings confirm the previous observation that IL-29 may skew the balance of Th1 and Th2 cytokine towards Th1 and a pronounced cytotoxic T-cell response [18], [19], [21], [38]. Secretion of Th1-cytokines acts as an important suppressor of Th2-cell differentiation [50], [51] via IFN response factors [51] and is associated with lower antibody titers after influenza vaccination [52]. Interestingly, the effect of IL-28B treatment was stronger in minor allele genotypes. The reduced effects in major allele genotypes could be due to a higher baseline expression of IL-28B and saturation of the signalling cascade. This is supported by a study in hepatocytes, where the minor allele genotype was associated with a higher baseline IL28RA expression and increased susceptibility and responses to IFN-λs [53]. A similar mechanism could be present in antigen presenting cells, which in turn has then affects the down-stream effects on T-cells and antibody production.We further used peptides to inhibit IL-28R signalling. These peptides have previously been described [29]. Inhibition of the IL-28B signalling during vaccination offers the potential to enhance Th2 cytokine release and thereby boost pathogen-specific IgG. It has been previously shown that signalling of the IFN pathway suppresses IgG secretion via increasing Th1 cytokines and a more cytotoxic immune response [52]. In particular antagonistic peptides 1, 6, 16 and 17 are promising candidates with high binding affinities to IL28RA, a strong potential to inhibit binding of IFN-λs and the ability to significantly increase in vitro H1N1-induced IgG production. These antagonistic peptides may enable immunomodulation towards Th2 cytokines and have the potential to become a new class of adjuvants by modulating IFN.An important strength of our study is the use of a clinical cohort including immunosuppressed transplant recipients to confirm our findings in the clinical setting. We then sought to define additional observations to support our clinical findings making our study unique. One limitation of our study is the heterogeneity of the transplant cohort due to a variety of underlying conditions leading to organ failure. However, the immunosuppressive treatment was not significantly different between genotype groups. In addition, we have shown that mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and the IL-28B major-allele genotype are independent factors for IgG production and that IFN-λ mRNA expression is not influenced by MMF. Another limitation of our study was that at the time of peptide design, only the crystal structure of IL-29 was available and the peptides are therefore based on IL-29 and not IL-28B. However, as IL-29 has a significantly greater binding affinity towards IL28RA compared to IL-28B, this could be advantageous as we are potentially blocking all IFN-λs with greater efficiency. The role of the IL10RB co-recruitment also needs to be further defined.In summary, SNPs in IL-28B play a key role in vaccine responses especially for influenza vaccine response in immunosuppressed patients. Peptides used to inhibit IFN lambda receptor signalling may play a role in augmenting vaccine responses and as such, represents a novel avenue for developing new adjuvants. Further studies in other populations such as other immunosuppressed populations, elderly persons and healthy individuals would also lead to improved vaccine strategies."
