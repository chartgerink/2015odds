"Treatment Results
As previously described, 74 HCV mono-infected and 35 HIV/HCV co-infected patients were treated in the ATAHC cohort [18]. The baseline characteristics of the patients are shown in Table 1. To avoid spurious conclusions, analysis was limited to those who were compliant with treatment (≥80% of the prescribed peginterferon regimen) (n = 89). Among HCV mono-infected adherent patients, 55% achieved RVR, 76% cEVR, 82% ETR and 72% SVR. In those with HIV/HCV co-infection, 41% achieved RVR, 85% cEVR, 81% ETR and 75% SVR.

Plasma IP-10 Levels by Baseline Characteristics
Plasma IP-10 levels at baseline ranged from 47 to 3,071 pg/mL and were positively skewed with a median of 212 pg/mL and a mean of 365±456 pg/mL. IP-10 levels correlated with HCV RNA titre (p<0.0001, r = 0.42) (Figure 1) and mean baseline IP-10 levels were higher in those with HCV RNA above 400,000 IU/mL (522±110 vs. 246±42 pg/mL, P = 0.012) (Figure 2a). Mean IP-10 levels were higher in patients with the treatment unfavorable IL28B genotype at rs8099917 (non-TT: 505±122 vs. TT: 278±31, P = 0.04). Mean IP-10 levels at baseline did not differ by HCV genotype (genotype 1∶420±85 pg/mL vs. genotype non-1∶291±49 pg/mL, P = 0.25), sex (men: 406±67 pg/mL vs. women: 227±27 pg/mL, P = 0.17), ethnicity (Caucasian: 367±61 pg/mL vs. Non-Caucasian: 355±110 pg/mL, p = 0.94), HIV status (HIV +ve: 465±114 vs. HIV –ve: 300±48, P = 0.14) or the presence of symptoms at presentation (symptomatic: 352±114 vs. asymptomatic: 368±61, P = 0.91) (Figure 2 b–g).

Mean plasma IP-10 levels were compared using the student’s t-test with Welch’s correction for unequal variances as appropriate. Plasma IP-10 Levels and Treatment Response
Mean IP-10 levels at baseline were lower in patients who achieved RVR than in those who did not (RVR: 240±26 pg/mL vs 492±100 pg/mL, P = 0.024) (Figure 3a) with similar results seen restricting the analysis to those with genotype 1 infection (RVR: 230±41 pg/mL vs 560±140 pg/mL, P = 0.033) (Figure 4a). Only 1 of 10 (10%) patients with baseline IP10 level above 600 pg/mL (616 pg/mL) had an RVR compared to 30 of 58 (52%) of those with baseline IP-10 below this threshold (P = 0.017). Conversely, patients with low baseline IP-10 (<150 pg/mL) were more likely to achieve RVR (IP-10<150 pg/mL: 12 of 18 (67%) RVR vs IP-10≥150 pg/mL: 20 of 50 (40%) RVR, P = 0.061), with similar results with the whole cohort and in those with genotype 1 infection (Figure 5a, b). IP-10 levels did not correlate with estimated duration of infection (r = -0.06, P = 0.60) and the relationship between RVR and IP-10 remained significant after controlling for estimated duration of infection (adjusted OR for RVR with IP-10<150 pg/mL: 0.29, 95% CI 0.09–0.94, P = 0.039).

Response based on baseline IP-10 level above or below 150 pg/mL among adherent individuals.
The proportion of patients with baseline IP-10 levels above or below 150 pg/mL who achieved RVR, cEVR, ETR and SVR are shown for a) the whole cohort and b) patients with genotype 1 infection. Responses were compared using Fisher’s Exact Test. Baseline IP-10 levels did not differ between patients who did and did not achieve cEVR, ETR or SVR in the whole cohort (Figure 3b–d) or in patients with genotype 1 infection only (Figure 4b–d). Furthermore, the proportion of patients with cEVR, ETR and SVR did not differ between those with baseline IP-10 above or below 150 pg/mL, 600 pg/mL or any other threshold value. Notably, although only one of the 10 adherent patients with baseline IP-10 levels >600 pg/mL achieved RVR, 6 of these 10 patients went on to SVR. Association of Plasma IP-10 Levels with IL28B Genotype and HCV RNA
Notably, IL28B genotype was not associated with RVR (TT vs non-TT: OR 1.67, 95% CI 0.68–4.1, P = 0.26) and did not confound the relationship between IP-10 levels below 150 pg/mL and RVR (adjusted OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.08–0.96, P = 0.043). However, the baseline HCV RNA level was strongly associated with early treatment outcome. Only 7 of 33 (21%) patients with HCV RNA levels above 400,000 IU/mL achieved RVR including 0 of 7 who also had an IP-10 level >600 pg/mL, compared to 36 of 51 (71%) with RNA titres below 400,000 IU/mL (P<0.001). After controlling for HCV RNA level, IP-10 below 150 pg/mL was no longer associated with RVR (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.19–2.35, P = 0.53). By multivariate logistic regression, HCV RNA below 400,000 IU/mL, genotype non-1 and an estimated duration of infection less than 6 months remained significantly associated with RVR (Table 2).

IP-10 levels declined with the fall in HCV RNA. There was a correlation between the change in log IP-10 and change in log HCV RNA from baseline to week 4 (r = 0.52, P = 0.06) and baseline to week 12 (r = 0.31, P = 0.015). Beyond week 4, the decline in HCV RNA was more rapid in patients who received ribavirin, but only in those who started with a baseline IP-10>150 pg/mL. In those with low baseline IP-10, the decline was similar with and without ribavirin therapy (Figure 6). IP-10 declined in patients who achieved an SVR but returned to near baseline levels in those who failed to reach this endpoint (Delta log IP-10 baseline to week 48 in SVR: 0.42±0.06 vs. No SVR: 0.05±0.07, P = 0.001).
10.1371/journal.pone.0080003.g006Figure 6
Early virological decline among adherent participants with recent HCV.
The decline in HCV RNA during the first 12 weeks of treatment is shown in patients with high baseline plasma IP-10 in those with HCV monoinfection (PEG-IFN) (>150 pg/mL, circles and solid line) or HIV/HCV co-infection (PEG-IFN/ribavirin) (≥150 pg/mL, upward triangles and solid line). The HCV RNA decline is also shown for patients with low baseline plasma IP-10 levels and HCV monoinfection (<150 pg/mL, downward triangles and dotted line) or HCV/HIV co-infection (<150 pg/mL, squares and dotted line).
Baseline levels of IP-10 have been shown to correlate with treatment outcome in chronic HCV infection, with higher levels predicting treatment failure. In this cohort of acute and early chronic HCV infection, baseline IP-10 levels were predictive of early viral kinetics but not ultimate treatment outcome. These findings may have important clinical and pathophysiological significance.Patients with low baseline IP-10 levels (<150 pg/mL) were more likely to achieve an RVR than those with higher IP-10 levels, even after controlling for estimated duration of infection and IL28B genotype. Beyond this early time-point, baseline IP-10 level and HCV RNA titre were no longer predictive of treatment response.The finding that IP-10 levels were not predictive of ultimate treatment outcome may have important clinical implications. We recently reported that higher IP-10 levels were associated with failure of spontaneous HCV clearance in acute infection [21]. No patients with a baseline IP-10 level above 380 pg/mL went on to clear virus without therapy. Furthermore high IP-10 during acute infection may be predictive of persistently high IP-10 after progressing to chronicity [25], which may impair future treatment responses. High pre-treatment IP-10 levels are associated with reduced rates of SVR during PEG-IFN/RBV treatment of chronic HCV [14], [15], [17], [23], [26], [27]. An unfavorable IL28B genotype and absence of symptoms are also associated with failure of spontaneous clearance, but like IP-10 [22], [28], they do not appear to affect the response to treatment during acute HCV. Collectively these data suggest that patients with high baseline IP-10 levels (>150 pg/mL), particularly those with asymptomatic disease and/or an unfavourable IL28B genotype, should be prioritized for early antiviral therapy because they are unlikely to achieve spontaneous clearance but still have a high likelihood of SVR with treatment during the acute phase of infection (Figure 7).10.1371/journal.pone.0080003.g007Figure 7
Proposed algorithm for incorporation of plasma IP-10 testing into clinical management of acute HCV infection.
The correlation of IP-10 levels with early but not late treatment responses is interesting and may offer some clues to explain the markedly different outcomes of interferon-based treatment in acute and chronic HCV infection. In chronic infection future non-responders to treatment have strong activation of ISGs in the liver prior to receiving interferon therapy [4], [5]. With near maximal ISG expression at baseline, ISGs cannot be further induced in non-responders despite interferon-based therapy [5], [6]. IP-10 in the serum appears to be a reflection of ISG preactivation in the liver; IP-10 serum levels correlate with IP-10 mRNA levels in liver biopsy tissue [17] and high serum IP-10 levels are associated with treatment non-response [14]. In this study of acute and early chronic HCV infection, patients with high baseline IP-10 responded less well to interferon with lower rates of RVR. However, unlike in the setting of established chronic infection, even patients with high baseline IP-10 levels with a poor initial response to therapy, were ultimately able to suppress virus and achieve SVR. This is particularly noteworthy given that apart from the HIV/HCV coinfected group, all ATAHC patients received PEG-IFN monotherapy. The difference in outcome in these scenarios is likely key to the difference in treatment response in acute and chronic HCV.There may be differences in both innate and adaptive immune responses in acute and chronic HCV. In a recent study by Dill and colleagues [29], liver biopsies were performed in 6 patients with acute HCV infection. They found that ISGs were induced in acute infection with IP-10 showing the strongest fold induction of any gene in all 6 patients. Due to the small numbers, they could not comment on the association of ISG expression and response. Interestingly, in the acute patients, the pattern of ISG induction was typical of the response to IFN-γ, rather than to IFN-α, IFN–β or IFN-λ, as is seen in chronic infection. Furthermore, ISG expression levels also correlated with IFN-γ mRNA levels in infiltrating CD8+ T cells suggesting that the adaptive T-cell response may be important. In chronic infection, adaptive immune responses are weak or undetectable and are not augmented with interferon treatment [30]. Rather, viral clearance appears to result from the direct antiviral effects of ISGs induced by interferon. In contrast, in acute HCV infection, there is a robust and broad adaptive response [30]. It is likely that interferon further stimulates the adaptive immune response, which, when combined with the direct antiviral effects of the innate response, is able to control and eradicate infection in the majority of patients [31]. Patients with higher baseline IP-10 levels still had a relatively weak direct antiviral response to interferon and hence had lower rates of RVR, but they were ultimately able to clear infection, likely because of stimulation of the adaptive response by interferon. This is in keeping with the observation that symptomatic acute infection is associated with clearance, a marker of a strong adaptive response targeting the liver [32].Exposure of hepatocytes to interferon-γ leads to ISG induction but does not result in an interferon-refractory state [29]. In contrast, cells exposed to Type I (α/β) or Type III (λ) interferons are refractory to subsequent treatment with interferon-α [33]–[35]. The levels of ISG induction in chronic HCV infection are strongly correlated with the IL28B genotype, with patients with the treatment-unfavourable (non-CC) genotype showing higher baseline hepatic ISG levels [11]. The mechanism remains unclear but many have speculated and there is some evidence that the IL28B genotype influences the degree of production and/or response to interferon-λ induced by HCV infection [36], [37]. Unlike in the setting of chronic infection, the IL28B genotype was not predictive of early or late treatment responses in this study, however patients with the treatment unfavourable IL28B genotype had higher baseline IP-10 levels. IP-10 levels correlated strongly with HCV RNA suggesting that HCV may be directly driving IP-10 and likely ISG expression. Dill and colleagues may be correct that the predominant interferon produced in response to acute HCV infection is interferon-γ [29], however in patients with very high IP-10 levels, Type I or Type III interferons may also be present, driving higher IP-10 levels and making cells refractory to both endogenous and therapeutic interferon. However, the robust adaptive immune response is still adequate to lead to viral clearance in the majority of patients.Casrouge and colleagues proposed [27] an alternative explanation to the seemingly paradoxical finding of high ISG activation leading to treatment failure. They showed that IP-10 can undergo cleavage to an inactive version of the chemokine that may act as a dominant-negative by binding the CXCR3 without leading to chemotaxis. Prevention of IP-10 cleavage restored hepatic T-cell infiltration in response to IP-10 in uninfected mice. In our study, only total IP-10 was measured without differentiation of the two isoforms. In chronic infection, Casrouge et al found that circulating IP-10 was predominantly the inactive cleaved form, which should prevent chemotaxis to the liver [27]. The high SVR rate in early HCV infection despite high IP-10 and a poor early response to interferon, would suggest that interferon is still able to promote a strong adaptive response in the liver, which ultimately drives viral clearance. It is possible that high circulating IP-10 levels are more a reflection of ISG preactivation with subsequent poor ISG induction in response to interferon than a marker of poor chemotaxis to the liver. Further studies on cleaved IP-10 will hopefully shed some further light on its relevance in HCV infection.Ribavirin has been previously shown to affect the second phase decline in HCV RNA during interferon-based therapy [38]. One proposed mechanism for the effect of ribavirin is augmentation of ISG induction by interferon [39], [40]. Previous studies have shown that ribavirin has the greatest effect on the second phase decline in patients with intermediate interferon sensitivity, with minimal benefit seen in those with either very strong or very weak interferon responses [41], [42]. Similarly in this study, ribavirin had little effect in patients with low IP-10 levels at baseline, patients likely to be very responsive to interferon, whereas in those with high baseline IP-10 (>150 pg/mL), ribavirin accentuated the later phase of viral decline, beyond week 4.This study has some important limitations. Because of the known relationship between IP-10 and treatment outcome in chronic infection, it is possible that the IP-10-RVR relationship seen in this cohort was driven by those with early chronic rather than true acute HCV infection. However IP-10 was associated with RVR after controlling for estimated duration of infection and there was no correlation between IP-10 and SVR as seen in chronic HCV infection. In chronic HCV infection, the relationship between IP-10 and SVR is strongest in patients with genotype 1 infection. The lack of association with IP-10 levels and SVR in this cohort was also seen when the analysis was restricted to those with genotype 1 only, however given the relatively small number of genotype 1 patients (n = 50), it is possible that an association with IP-10 levels and SVR in genotype 1 patients may have been missed. Unfortunately serum was collected prior to recognition of IP-10 cleavage. Post-collection cleavage of IP-10 occurs unless a specific inhibitor is added to the serum at collection and hence it was not possible to accurately determine the ratio of cleaved to uncleaved IP-10 [27]. Finally, although this is one of the larger treatment studies of early HCV infection, the number of patients is still relatively small, limiting the strength of the conclusions.In summary, baseline IP-10 levels were associated with early viral kinetics but not ultimate treatment outcome to interferon-based therapy in acute or early chronic HCV infection. IP-10 levels correlated with HCV RNA before, during and after treatment. Given previous data showing that patients with high baseline IP-10 are unlikely to spontaneously clear HCV infection they should be prioritized for early interferon-based treatment."
