"The identification of IL-28B gene structure To define the human IL-28A or IL-28B gene structure, 5′-RACE and 3′-RACE were performed on total extracted RNA from HeLa, MT-2, Raji, HuH7 cells, and PBMCs from healthy volunteers (Fig. 2A). The sequences obtained matched the genomic contig of AC011445, which contains the sequence of IL-28A and IL-28B in forward and reverse orientations, respectively. All intron/exon junctions conformed to the canonical GT-AG rule. After stimulation of cells with LPS (3 µg/ml) for 4 h following IFN-α treatment (100 U/mL) for 16 h, IL-28A/B transcripts were detected in RACE experiments, but these were not detected in unstimulated cells. The representative TSSs are shown in Fig. 2B and showed little variation among cloned mRNA transcripts. The same 3′-UTR fragment also was detected without any intron in the 3′-RACE experiments (Fig. 2C). A polyadenylation signal (AAAUAAA), located in the 3′-UTR, was found upstream of the polyadenylation site in all samples. All sequences from the transcripts were aligned on the 5′-UTR, the six exons, and the 3′-UTR region of IL-28A/B. No different mRNA transcripts of IL-28A/B were found in our experiment. Taken together, the IL-28B gene structure comprised six exons (see Fig. 2D), and the location of SNP no. 3 (rs28416813) is in an intron, rather than a regulatory region (Table 1). 10.1371/journal.pone.0026620.g002 Figure 2 The determination of IL-28B gene structure and UTR region. IL-28A/B cDNA was isolated using a complete cDNA cloning method and the entire sequences were determined using HeLa, MT-2, and Raji call lines and PBMC from healthy volunteers. (A) 5′- and 3′-RACE analyses were used to determine the complete sequence of IL-28A/B mRNA after LPS stimulation (3 µg/mL) for 4 h following IFN-α treatment (100 U/mL) for 16 h. A representative example of agarose gel electrophoresis is shown for the non-stimulated control (NC). PCR products were inserted into the cloning vector and 6 clones of 5′- and 3′-RACE were analyzed by sequencing. (B) mRNA sequences of the 5′ terminal region were aligned using CCDS retrieved from NCBI and RACE data of IL-28A/B. The upper two sequences are reference sequences from the NCBI CCDS and the lower two are representative sequences of IL-28A and 28B obtained from 5′-RACE. The underlined triplet indicates the start codon of each gene and arrow shows the splice junctions. (C) mRNA sequences of the 3′ terminal region were aligned using CCDS retrieved from NCBI and RACE data from IL-28A/B. The double-underlined triplet indicates the stop codon of each gene and arrows show the splice junctions. The polyA signal and representative site of polyadenylation also are shown. (D) The derived gene structure of the IL-28B is shown with the significant SNPs. The location of SNP No. 3 was changed from the regulatory to an intron region. The transcription start site (TSS) is found behind SNP No. 2. The effect of regulatory SNPs on promoter activity Because the TSS was upstream of the position described in previous reports (Fig. 2), two rSNPs (rs72258881 and rs4803219) in the regulatory region were more specifically located in the TSS. A luciferase reporter approach was used to assess the effects of the two rSNPs on promoter activity. Luciferase vectors harboring the rSNPs were constructed and used for transfections (Fig. 3A). The promoter activities of the constructs were measured after stimulation with LPS (3 µg/ml) for 4 h following IFN-α treatment (100 U/mL) for 16 h. The transcriptional activity of constructions harboring the (TA)11 mutation was reduced (Fig. 3B). Substitution in the rSNP (rs4803219) showed little effect on the transcriptional activity, whereas the number of TA repeats could be responsible for the putative region controlling basal transcription. To confirm the transcriptional activity, Jurkat cells were transfected with full length constructs expressing the FLAG sequence under the control of the natural promoter (Fig. 3C). To avoid the detection of endogenous mRNA, the mRNA with the FLAG sequence was specifically detected by real time PCR using the FLAG primer. The constructs harboring (TA)11 yielded lower expression levels after IFN-α and LPS stimulation (Fig. 3D), suggesting that the length of TA repeat in the regulatory region of IL-28B could affect the regulation of IL-28B transcription. 10.1371/journal.pone.0026620.g003 Figure 3 Transcriptional activity of the IL-28B promoter region compared between major and minor alleles. (A) The pGL4 reporter plasmid was constructed by subcloning the IL-28B promoter subfragment (nt −858 to +30). The combinations of two regulatory SNPs (rs72258881 or rs4803219) were introduced into the pGL4 vector (pGL4/WW, MW, WM, and MM). (B) Raji cells were co-transfected with pGL4 plasmids (0.05 g), and pGL4.74 control plasmid (0.05 g), and tested for firefly as well as renilla luciferase after LPS stimulation (3 µg/mL) for 4 h following IFN-α treatment (100 U/mL) for 16 h. These cells were seeded in a 96-well plate at 104 cells/well. The luciferase activities were normalized with renilla activities and data are presented as fold induction from activation of control vector. Bars indicate the means ± SD of triplicate determinations and the results are from one of three experiments. Statistical analyses are shown in table S2 to avoid complication. (C) For real-time PCR, the combinations of two regulatory SNPs (rs72258881 or rs4803219) were introduced into the pdCMV vector harboring a FLAG sequence (pdCMV/WW, MW, WM, and MM). (D) Jurkat cells were co-transfected with pdCMV plasmids (0.05 µg) and secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) control plasmid (0.05 µg) and the expression levels were quantified using specific primer after LPS and IFN-α stimulation. The FLAG expression levels were normalized with SEAP activities and GAPDH as described in method section. Data are presented as fold induction from expression levels of pdCMV/WW. Bars indicate the means ± SD of triplicate determinations and the results are from one of three experiments. Statistical analyses are shown in table S3 to avoid complication. Two intron SNPs located near the branch site of splicing To determine the effect of the two iSNPs on pre-mRNA splicing, HeLa cells were transfected with wild type (WT), a construct with a double mutation of the iSNPs (d-iSNPs), or an antisense (AS) plasmid driven by the CMV promoter (Fig. 4A). The construct providing antisense transcription controlled by the CMV promoter was used to control for splicing defects (AS). Transcripts were analyzed by RT-PCR using primers in exon 1–2, 3–4, and 4–5. The RNA isolated from the WT and d-iSNPs yielded a single band using the three primer pairs. In contrast, longer amplicons were generated in cells expressing the antisense construct (Fig. 4B). The PCR products were sequenced to confirm the origin of the aberrant splicing events derived from the antisense construct (data not shown). The sequence analyses confirmed that PCR products from the WT and d-iSNPs were generated by normal splicing, suggesting that these two intron SNPs resulted in no splicing defects under these conditions. 10.1371/journal.pone.0026620.g004 Figure 4 The determination of intron SNPs located near the branch site of splicing. (A) The expression plasmid of WT, d-iSNPs, or antisense (AS) derived from the CMV promoter was transfected into HeLa cells. Schematic of the WT, d-iSNPs, or AS used in the transfection experiments. PCR primers were designed to amplify products between exons. The effect of No. 3 and 5 SNPs (rs28416813 or rs11881222) on splicing were examined by amplicons x and y, respectively. The amplicon z was used for a splicing control. (B) Isolated RNAs were amplified by RT-PCR. The amplified products were checked by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis. The bands from the AS plasmid transcribing antisense represented abnormal splicing of mRNA as a control. Results shown are representative of three independent experiments. No effect of nonsynonymous SNPs on IL-28B function A nonsynonymous SNPs (rs8103142) located in the 3rd exon (Table 1 and Fig. 2D) led to the amino acid substitution K74R (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, the amino acid at this position is almost always arginine in homologous mammalian IFN-λs (e.g. human IL-28A, mouse IL-28A/B, and rhesus IL-28A/B). Then, the K74R substitution was expected to change IL-28B activity. The purified recombinant IL-28B protein (wild type) and the variant (ns-mut) were recognized by anti-IL-28B polyclonal antibody in a western blot assay (Fig. 5B). Based on spectrophotometric measurement of the protein concentration of the eluted fraction, it was calculated that at least 360 µg/mL of purified recombinant IL-28B protein (wild type and ns-mut) was obtained after purification. Flow-through liquid without recombinant protein was provided in the column preparing the sample of pcDNA3.1/AS (Fig. 5B). Molecular processing of IL-28B protein was confirmed to determine the precise N-terminal amino acid by peptide sequencer as the processing site of signal peptide was predicted by computer simulation (http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q8IZI9). Then, the N-terminal sequence, VPVAR, was obtained (data not shown), suggesting that the simulation data was consistent with the form of physiological protein. 10.1371/journal.pone.0026620.g005 Figure 5 The purification and the activity of recombinant IL-28B with or without nsSNP. (A) The 6×His-tagged expression plasmid of wild type, ns-mut, or AS controlled by the CMV promoter was transfected into 293F cells. Schematics are the wild type, ns-mut and AS used in the transfection experiments. The procedure for recombinant protein purification is described in the materials and methods section. (B) The purified products were confirmed by immunoblotting using anti-IL28B antibody and the secondary antibody. The prepared proteins were loaded onto a 12% polyacrylamide gel. Bands corresponding to the expected molecular weight of IL-28B were observed in the wild type and ns-mut lanes. (C) For luciferase assay, HeLa cells were seeded into a 96-well plate at 104 cells/well and transfected with pISRE-Luc and pGL4.74 control vector before 16 h of IFN-α or IL-28B stimulation. Five ng/mL of IL-28B wild or ns-mut was added to the culture medium. Flow-though liquid from AS expression was used as a negative control. IFN-α (100 U/mL) was added for positive control of ISRE activity. The luciferase activities were normalized with Renilla activities and data are presented as fold induction from the basal promoter activation of the wild type. Bars indicate the means ± SD of triplicate determinations and the results are from one of three experiments. To evaluate the effect of nsSNPs on ISRE activity, three hepatoma cell lines (HuH7, HepG2, and HuSE2) expressing IL-28R1 and IL-10R2 were transfected with pISRE-Luc and pGL4.74. These recombinant proteins were added to the supernatant (5 ng/mL each). As shown in Fig. 5C, ISRE activity of the ns-mut protein was similar to that of wild type protein in each cell line. IFN-α (100 U/mL), as a positive control of ISRE activity, showed a strong ISRE activity. These results suggested that the nonsynonymous mutation of rs8103142 did not affect IL-28B activity in vitro. The genetic variation of TA repeats at the upstream of IL-28B The reference sequence (RefSeq) of the human genome in the international database registers the TA repeat SNPs, rs72284729 or rs72258881, in the regulatory regions of IL-28A and IL-28B, respectively. The registered basal number of (TA)n is 8 in the regulatory region of IL-28A on the plus strand, whereas that of IL-28B is 13 on the minus strand encoding the gene (Table 2). From 20 Japanese healthy volunteers, genomic DNA was extracted to determine the actual (TA)n number located in the region of IL-28A or IL-28B by direct sequencing and, when direct sequencing chromatographs of (TA)n heterozygotes showed mixed patterns from the end of the TA repeat (Fig. S4), the mixed samples were subjected to cloning analysis. Interestingly, the (TA)n number in IL-28A was consistently different from dbSNP data, whereas that of IL-28B showed varying numbers along with SNPs data. The (TA)n range of IL-28B was from 10 to 18, and the most prevalent genotype was 12/12 (75%) in healthy Japanese volunteers. 10.1371/journal.pone.0026620.t002Table 2 The variations of TA repeat in IL-28A and 28B. Location Gene Data rs72284792*1 rs72258881 IL-28A RefSeq. (hg19) (TA)8 Cloning (TA)8 IL-28B RefSeq. (hg19) (TA)13 Cloning (TA)10–18 *1The ID represents rs72258881, rs59702201, and rs67461793 because these three are located in the same genomic region, the TA repeat. To determine the functional significance of the TA indel, the regulatory region from −858 bp to +30 bp modifying the (TA)n number was cloned into the pGL4 reporter vector, transfected into HeLa cells, and assessed for firefly luciferase reporter gene expression (Fig. 6A). These cells were treated with 100 U/mL of IFN-α and 3 µg/mL of LPS. The results indicated that the variation in the (TA)n number at this polymorphic locus differentially regulates transcription. The transcriptional activation of the luciferase reporter gene was increased according to the (TA)n number (Fig. 6B). 10.1371/journal.pone.0026620.g006 Figure 6 Luciferase assay of (TA)n number. (A) IL-28B promoter subfragment (nt −858 to +30) modifying (TA)n number from 10 to 18 was constructed in the pGL4 vector. (B) Raji cells were co-transfected with pGL4 plasmids (0.05 g), and pGL4.74 control plasmid (0.05 g), and tested for firefly as well as renilla luciferase after LPS stimulation (3 µg/mL) for 4 h following IFN-α treatment (100 U/mL) for 16 h. These cells were seeded into a 96-well plate at 104 cells/well. The luc activities were normalized with renilla activities and data are presented as fold induction from the activation of the control vector. Bars, the means ± SD of triplicate determinations and the results are from one of three experiments. Statistical analyses are shown in table S4 to avoid complication. Four independent GWAS approaches have revealed the significant SNPs associated with response to PEG-IFNα/RBV therapy for CHC [12], [13], [14], [19]. These significant SNPs were found around IL-28B but not IL-28A. The SNPs found in clinical studies to determine the outcome of HCV therapy were rs12979860 and rs8099917, because they showed the statistical significance in each study [12], [13], [14], [19]. However, several SNPs around IL-28B were in strong LD (r2>0.96) in JPT and CEU populations, although relatively low LD was predicted in the YRI population [16], and so it might be difficult to determine the most informative SNP [16]. These results suggest that any of the SNPs contained in this region could be of predictive value.As reported in previous studies, transcription of IL-28A/B was upregulated in the TT genotype of rs8099917, which was associated with SVR [13], [14], [20], suggesting that the expression levels of IL-28B could be one of the key factors to clear HCV under PEG-IFNα/RBV therapy and could also affect spontaneous clearance of acute HCV infection [15]. To elucidate this question, we examined the function of the SNPs around the IL-28B gene to identify those SNPs affecting IL-28B expression. The new findings are as follows: 1) the gene structure of IL-28B comprised six exons in the several cell lines tested, although it was registered as having five exons in the CCDS database of NCBI. 2) The substitution of intron SNPs and non-synonymous SNPs in the IL-28B gene did not influence the expression levels or function. 3) Increased numbers of TA repeats in the promoter region of the IL-28B gene enhanced the transcription activity and expression level of the IL-28B gene. Because administration of IL-28B has been shown to have antiviral effects [21], [22], [23], lower expression of IL-28B might lead to a decrease in this effect.The locations of two SNPs associated with response to HCV therapy, rs8099917 and rs12979860, are approximately 8 kb and 3 kb upstream of IL-28B gene, respectively. Because these SNPs, which showed the greatest statistical significance in the previous study, are located far from the IL-28B gene, another approach was required to determine the effect of the SNPs. In this study, broad (TA)n variations were observed in rs8099917 heterozygotes among CHC patients. Interestingly, a combination of TG and 11/12 genotype was strongly associated with NVR, whereas patients harboring the 12/13 genotype showed a virological response, regardless of the TG genotype (rs8099917). In clinical practice, genetic diagnosis using TA variation, following the primary classification of rs8099917 genotype, could improve the prediction of treatment response for CHC patients with the rs8099917 TG genotype. It is not clear whether the variation originates from genetic or epigenetic mechanisms. In addition, as the frequency of TA variation might be dependent on the particular population, further study will be needed to compare the frequency in several populations. A long TA repeat, over (TA)13, was observed in healthy volunteers and showed potential for higher gene expression compared with under (TA)13 constructs in vitro. It may be possible that spontaneous clearance of HCV infection and CHC patients are affected by this region because this also is dependent on IL-28B genotype [15], [19]. In our speculation, the combination of both TA variation and the landmark SNPs, rs8099917 and rs12979860, might improve the prediction value. In addition, convenient diagnosis method to detect the TA variation like SNPs typing is needed since the present capillary techniques are relative complexity compared with SNPs typing.In the international database, some SNPs ID are registered in the TA repeat region, located in the regulatory regions of the IL-28A and IL-28B gene, rs72284792 and rs7225881, respectively, whereas in our analysis separating IL-28A from IL-28, TA variation was detected only in the IL-28B region. SNP data often have been collected using next generation sequencing and based on short sequence reads. Unfortunately, the sequence similarity between IL-28A and IL-28B is over 90% from the CpG island to the region downstream of 3′-UTR. Alignment failure would occur for a high percentage of sequences when analyzed with software using general algorithms.Effects of insertion/deletion (indel) polymorphism are known in the field of pharmacogenetic research. A polymorphism in the promoter of the uridine diphosphoglucuronosyl transferase 1A1 (UGT 1A1) gene has been shown to cause Crigler-Najjar syndrome types I and II and Gilbert syndrome, a benign form of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, and the occurrence of severe toxic events in irinotecan (known as CPT-11) administration [24], [25], [26]. The polymorphism consists of a (TA)n repeat in the 5′-promoter region [24], [26], [27], similar to that in this study. The range of repeat numbers is from (TA)5 to (TA)8 in the UGT 1A1 gene [28]. The genetic disorder of the TA repeat length affects enzyme activity. The hepatic bilirubin UGT 1A1 activity of individuals with Gilbert's syndrome is <30% of normal [29]. Irinotecan is used or under evaluation for a broad spectrum of solid tumors. Irinotecan pharmacokinetic parameters display a wide inter-patient variability and are involved in the genesis of toxic side effects [30], [31], [32], [33]. Based on the polymorphism of the TA repeat, previous papers reported the association of irinotecan-induced severe toxicity with Gilbert's syndrome [34], [35], [36]. The value of genetic diagnosis of the UGT1A1 polymorphisms prior to irinotecan chemotherapy has been corroborated in a previous study [37]. As similar characteristics were observed in the upstream region of IL-28B, the (TA)n repeat might be associated with disease progression as well as response to anti-HCV treatment.In terms of epigenetic aspects, the TA variation of IL-28B was also suspected to be related to microsatellite instability, because a gap between the significant SNPs and TA variation was observed in this study. DNA mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency causes a high frequency of microsatellite instability (MSI-H), which is characterized by length alterations within simple repeated sequences, microsatellites. Lynch syndrome is primarily due to germline mutations in one of the DNA MMR genes, hMLH1 or hMSH2 [38]. MSI-H is also observed in <15% of colorectal, gastric and endometrial cancers, where it is associated with the hypermethylation of the promoter region of hMLH1 [39], [40]. The diagnosis of MSI-H in cancers is therefore useful for identifying patients with Lynch syndrome and the efficacy of chemotherapy [41], [42], [43], [44], [45], [46].In conclusion, a (TA) dinucleotide repeat, rs72258881, located in the promoter region, was discovered by our functional studies of the proximal SNPs around IL-28B; the transcriptional activity of the promoter increased gradually in a (TA)n length-dependent manner. Combination diagnosis based on rs8099917 and rs72258881 might provide improved prediction because the (TA)n variation of IL-28B was observed but not that of IL-28A. The further study is needed to reveal the association with treatment response using clinical specimens of CHC. These findings suggest that the dinucleotide repeat could be associated with the transcriptional activity of IL-28B as well as constituting a predictor to improve prediction of the response to interferon-based HCV treatment."
