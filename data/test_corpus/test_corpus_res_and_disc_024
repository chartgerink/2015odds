"All the SNPs studied satisfied the quality control filters in all 261 individuals, and the allelic frequencies are reported in figure 1A. Three SNPs at the 3′ (rs958039) and the 5′ (rs10424607 and rs576832) boundaries of the IL28B region were monomorphic, whereas the frequencies of the other SNPs were similar to those observed in European populations. Univariate association analyses showed that the six polymorphic SNPs in the Egyptian population were strongly associated with spontaneous HCV clearance (Figure 1A). The most significant results were obtained with an additive genetic model, with rs12979860 [odds ratio of presenting HCV clearance (OR) for CT vs.TT (or CC vs.CT) = 2.84 (95% confidence interval: 1.87–4.30); P = 1.6×10−7] and rs8103142 [OR = 2.76 (1.84–4.13); P = 1.6×10−7]. Association analyses conducted for these two SNPs separately in our two cohorts provided very similar results in terms of allele frequencies and odds-ratios indicating that possible HBV co-infection in some patients of our first cohort could not affect these results. In our whole sample, and taking rs8103142 as an example, the proportion of subjects with HCV clearance was much higher in subjects carrying the protective TT genotype (66% of clearers) than in those with CT (39% of clearers) or CC (23% of clearers) genotypes (Figure 1B).We then carried out multivariate regression analysis with the six polymorphic SNPs. When the most significant SNP (rs12979860) was introduced into the model, the other five SNPs ceased to be significantly associated with clearance, confirming that this association was based on a single signal. We then estimated pairwise LD between the six polymorphic SNPs. The LD pattern of these SNPs, and that of rs12979860 in particular (see Figure S1A), in this Egyptian population was similar to that in European populations (see Figure S1B). The non-synonymous SNP rs8103142 could not be included in this comparison, as no genotyping data were available for the CEU population. The r2 for the relationship between rs8103142 and rs12979860 was estimated at 0.96 in another European population [20] and 0.88 in our Egyptian population. The three remaining SNPs were monomorphic in the Egyptian population, whereas they form part of the IL28B cluster associated with HCV clearance in the European population (Figure 1A). Interestingly, these three SNPs are located at the 3′ (rs958039) and 5′ (rs10424607 and rs576832) ends of the genomic region corresponding to IL28B (Figure 1A), reducing the size of the LD block in the Egyptian population by about one third. Overall, these observations suggest that the causal SNPs underlying the association with HCV clearance are located in a smaller region of ∼20 kilobases located between rs958039 and rs10424607 rather than in a long-range LD block.Finally, we estimated haplotype frequencies derived from the six polymorphic SNPs in this population. The objective of this haplotype analysis was not to test formally for differences in haplotype frequencies between subjects with clearance and those with chronic infection, but to further refine our univariate results by providing the general haplotype structure of this Egyptian sample. Seven haplotypes had an estimated frequency >0.02 in the whole sample. Based on differences in haplotype frequencies between subjects with spontaneous clearance and those with chronic infection, these seven haplotypes could be classified into two protective (favouring clearance) haplotypes (one of which was much more common than the other) and five “at risk” haplotypes (conferring a predisposition to chronic infection) (Figure 2). The two protective haplotypes differed only in terms of the allele of SNP rs4803217. In comparisons with the alleles present in the two protective haplotypes, only two SNPs presented the alternative allele in all five at risk haplotypes, discrepancies being observed for the others. The two SNPs with consistently different alleles between the protective and at risk haplotypes were rs12979860 and rs8103142, the non-synonymous SNP. This observation is consistent with the univariate association results and supports the view that the core of the association is dependent on these two SNPs, the effect of which are indistinguishable in this sample. 10.1371/journal.pone.0038578.g002 Figure 2 Haplotype frequencies estimated from the Egyptian population, as a function of HCV status. Haplotype frequencies are given for each of the two groups: individuals with persistent infection (“Chronic infection”) and individuals who cleared the infection (“Spontaneous clearance”). As defined in the text, the protective haplotypes (1 and 2) favour HCV clearance, whereas the “at risk” haplotypes (3 to 7) confer a predisposition to chronic HCV infection. The more frequent protective haplotype (haplotype 1) could be defined as the reference protective haplotype, while the more frequent “at risk” haplotype (haplotype 3), which is composed of the exact opposite alleles for all SNPs of haplotype 1, could be defined as the reference “at risk” haplotype. The dashed-line circles show discrepancies within the two protective haplotypes, i.e. between haplotype 2 and the reference protective haplotype 1. The dashed-line squares show discrepancies within the “at risk” haplotypes, i.e. between haplotypes 4–7 and the reference “at risk” haplotype 3. Only two SNPs identified by the solid-line rectangle (rs8103142 and rs12979860) shows have the same allele for the two protective haplotypes and the alternative allele in all the five at risk haplotypes. These results confirm the major role of IL28B variants in the spontaneous clearance of HCV genotype 4 infection in an Egyptian population. In particular, the magnitude of the association with rs12979860 observed is similar to that reported in many studies conducted on HCV genotype 1 infection [5], [20] and with the only previous study of HCV genotype 4 infection in an Egyptian population [10]. Our refined analysis, including eight additional IL28B SNPs, showed that the LD block of the IL28B SNP cluster associated with HCV clearance was shorter than that in European populations. In particular, this analysis reduces the chromosomal region in which the causal SNPs are potentially located to about 20 kilobases of the IL28B genomic region, excluding the IL28A genomic region. Finally, both our univariate and haplotype analyses clearly showed that the core association depended on two SNPs, rs12979860 and rs8103142. SNP rs8103142 replaces a lysine residue by an arginine residue at position 70 (K70R) in IFN-λ3, a substitution predicted to be benign by Polyphen [22]. Further functional studies are required to identify the causal SNPs underlying this strong association and the precise mechanisms of IL28B involvement in HCV infection."
