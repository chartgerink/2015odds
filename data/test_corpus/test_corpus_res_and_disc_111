"Study Population
We included 262 SHCS participants who fulfilled the inclusion criteria (Fig 1). Of those, 134 patients had HCV GT 1 or 4, and 128 GT 2 or 3 infections, respectively (Table 1). Among all included patients, the proportion of men was 72% and median age at HCV treatment start was 42 years. In 71% of the patients HIV was transmitted by intravenous drug use (IDU). Only 15/262 (6%) had CD4 cell counts less than 200 cells/μL and 81% were on antiretroviral therapy (ART) at HCV treatment start. Cirrhosis was present in 31% of participants. The IL28B CC genotype was documented in 51/116 (44%) persons with GT 1/4, and in 60/116 (52%) with GT 2/3 (in 30/262 patients genotyping was not performed because of missing genetic consent). SVR was achieved in 47/134 (35.1%) persons with GT 1/4, and in 90/128 (70.3%) with GT 2/3 infections. Baseline characteristics of patients stratified by HCV genotype (GT 1/4 vs.2/3) are shown in Table 1. 10.1371/journal.pone.0133879.g001

A total of 394 RBV drug levels were determined between week 4 and end of therapy. Number of patients with available RBV concentrations per genotype group and treatment phase is outlined in Fig 1. The patients contributing to the different treatment phases did not differ with regards to age, sex and transmission category (all p>0.06) besides patients from treatment phase week 4–12 versus 13–24 with GT 2/3 regarding transmission mode (p = 0.006) and age (p = 0.03). Overall median RBV plasma level was 2.0 mg/L in GT 1/4 and 1.9 mg/L in GT 2/3 infections (Table 2). Median RBV concentration was similar for all treatment phases (no significant difference between week 4–12, 13–24, and >24 in both genotype groups; all p-values >0.3). Since ROC analyses were not able to detect clearly discriminating cutoff values of RBV plasma concentration for the prediction of SVR, we dichotomized RBV levels as lower versus equal as or higher than the median (2.0 mg/L). In addition we also performed analyses using 2.5 mg/L as a cutoff (Table 2). 10.1371/journal.pone.0133879.t002

In patients with SVR RBV concentration was similar compared to patients without SVR, regardless of HCV genotype and treatment phase (Fig 2). RBV drug levels ≥2.0 mg/L and ≥2.5 mg/L were not significantly associated with SVR in both genotype groups (GT 1/4, ≥2.0 mg/L OR 1.19 [0.5–2.86]; ≥2.5 mg/L 1.56 [0.64–3.84]; GT 2/3, ≥2.0 mg/L 1.94 [0.78–4.80], ≥2.5 mg/L 2.72 [0.85–8.73]). In the multivariable regression analyses, IL28B genotype CC was a strong positive predictor for SVR in both genotype groups (GT 1/4, OR 3.96 [1.66–9.44], p = 0.002; GT 2/3, 3.02 [1.18–7.73], p = 0.02). A high HCV viral load was inversely correlated with HCV cure in GT 1/4 (0.38 [0.15–0.94], p = 0.04). Age, sex, and HIV transmission group had no significant influence on HCV treatment outcome (Table 3). 10.1371/journal.pone.0133879.g002

When we analyzed the association between RBV concentration and SVR in different treatment phases, neither RBV levels ≥2.0 mg/L, nor levels ≥2.5 mg/L in any of the treatment phases were significantly associated with HCV cure (Fig 3). When analyses were stratified by HCV genotype and IL28B genotype, RBV concentration levels remained without a significant impact on SVR in any group (Fig 3). 10.1371/journal.pone.0133879.g003

Multivariable logistic regression analysis, adjusted for age, sex, HIV transmission group and HCV RNA level. Abbreviations: CI, confidence interval; HCV, hepatitis C virus; OR, odds ratio; RBV, ribavirin. Several trials evaluated the impact of RBV therapeutic drug monitoring on SVR. Study results, however, remained controversial. We therefore assessed the correlation between RBV concentration and HCV cure in a large treatment naïve HIV/HCV-coinfected cohort treated with pegIFN/RBV. We found no difference in RBV concentrations between patients with and without SVR. RBV concentration levels ≥2.0 mg/L and ≥2.5 mg/L were not associated with HCV cure, regardless of HCV genotype, treatment phase (week 4–12, 13–24, >24), and IL28B genotype. Overall, median RBV concentrations were 2.0 mg/L in GT 1/4 and 1.9 mg/L in GT 2/3 infections, and there were no significant differences between treatment phases.RBV concentrations ≥2.0 mg/L, as well as ≥2.5 mg/L, did not differentiate between patients responding to HCV therapy and those not. In line with our results, there are previous studies in mono- and coinfected patients that did not find an association between RBV concentration and virologic response [10, 15, 16]. However, there are also several other studies showing such a correlation. In coinfected patients, RBV cutoffs of 1.6 mg/L [17], 2.0 mg/L [18], 2.3 mg/L [6], and 2.5mg/L [19] were established to improve treatment efficacy. Reasons for the contradicting results may be small patient numbers, heterogeneity of populations and different clinical settings.Previous trials showed that monitoring of RBV concentrations at weeks 4, 12, 24 (reviewed in [20]) or at treatment end [21] was associated with higher cure rates, while other studies only found a correlation of RBV concentration and increased response rates in difficult-to-treat patient groups, including GT 1 and 4 infections [6, 17], GT 1 coinfected patients with CT/TT IL28B genotypes [18], and African Americans with the CT/TT genotypes [22]. In our study, RBV concentrations at any treatment time point did not predict SVR. Moreover, we could not confirm that monitoring RBV steady-state levels may play a more important role in the achievement of HCV cure in patients with a higher risk of treatment failure.Median RBV steady state concentrations of 2.0 mg/L in GT 1/4 and 1.9 mg/L in GT 2/3 in our cohort were similar as in other cohorts of HIV/HCV-coinfected [18] and HCV-monoinfected patients with values ranging from 1.4 to 2.5 mg/L [5, 21]. In a recently published study, RBV area under the curve (AUC0-4h) within the first hours after RBV intake was significantly lower in a small group of coinfected compared to monoinfected persons. The conclusion was that lower early bioavailability of RBV could be one of the reasons for lower SVR rates in coinfected patients [23]. Our results with similar RBV steady state concentrations in coinfected compared to monoinfected patients of other cohorts, do not support this hypothesis.The overall SVR rates of 35.1% in GT 1/4 and 70.3% in GT 2/3 infections were high compared to other HIV/HCV-coinfected cohorts and similar to cure rates achieved in randomized controlled trials [24–26]. In a large cohort of US veterans, SVR was 16.7% in GT 1 and 44% in GT 2/3 infections during the same time period [27]. In our cohort, main predictors for SVR in both HCV genotype groups were IL28B genotype CC and low HCV RNA levels at baseline, which is in accordance with the results from other studies [19, 27, 28].Major strengths of this study include the large number of patients and RBV concentration measurements in a nation-wide representative cohort of HIV-infected patients in a real-life setting. The large sample size was sufficient to allow separate analyses for GT1/4 and GT 2/3 HCV infections, and stratification by treatment phase and IL28B genotype. Limitations include the retrospective study design. We did not collect RBV trough plasma concentrations. However because of RBVs long elimination half-life and a stable steady-state after week 4, timing of sample collection is less relevant.The new standard of care for HCV is DAA containing regimens, but RBV is still an essential backbone in many of these therapies. Our cohort does not yet provide information on the role of RBV drug monitoring in patients treated with DAA regimens. However, our data support current guidelines recommending weight-adapted RBV doses with close clinical monitoring and dose reduction, respectively discontinuation, in patients with signs of toxicity (dose-response relationship) rather than ribavirin concentration measurements (concentration-response relationship) [2], www.hcvguidelines.org). In resource limited settings where RBV/pegIFN is still standard of care and financial opportunities and laboratory infrastructure are limited our data does not support a role for RBV therapeutic drug monitoring [1].In conclusion, we did not find a correlation between RBV plasma concentration and SVR, regardless of HCV genotype, treatment phase and IL28B genotype. Our data do not support RBV therapeutic drug monitoring in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients treated with pegIFN/RBV to enhance the chance of HCV cure."
