"The study included 41 genotype 1 CHC patients that were predominantly Caucasian (78%), male (61%), treatment responders (63%) with moderate to advanced fibrosis (85%) and a mean age of 47.4 years. The favorable response IL28B CC genotype was observed in close to one-half of our cohort. Table 1 summarizes this patient cohort.10.1371/journal.pone.0021854.t001Table 1 Characteristics of the 41 Chronic HCV patients in the present study.

Latent factor modeling grouped the individual peptides into 110 metaproteins. P-values generated from the association analysis of each of the 110 metaproteins and rs12979860 genotype are shown in the quantile-quantile (QQ) plot in Figure 1. A single metaprotein showed significant association with IL28B genotype after Bonferroni correction for multiple hypothesis testing: the liver protein corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG; p = 9.2×10−6). The rs12979860 ‘C’ (responder) allele was associated with lower levels of CBG metaprotein and explained 46% of the variance in CBG metaprotein (Figure 2). These results remained significant when testing a recessive model (CC versus TC/TT; p = 7.45×10−5). 10.1371/journal.pone.0021854.g001 Figure 1 Quantile-Quantile plot showing the distribution of observed P values for IL28B rs12979860 genotype association with 110 metaproteins among chronic HCV patients to the expected distribution of P values under the null hypothesis.

Filled circles represent non-responders (NR) to interferon treatment and open circles are from subjects who achieved sustained virologic response (SVR) to treatment. If the previously reported association between IL28B and SVR is mediated through CBG, we would expect to see an association between CBG and SVR in this cohort as well. Indeed, we found a statistically significant association between the CBG metaprotein expression and SVR (p = 0.0148). We also found a statistically significant association (p = 0.0021) between the IL28B genotype and SVR, as reported previously in patients from the Duke Hepatology Clinic cohort [14]. However, when including both IL28B genotype and CBG in a model to predict SVR, the association with CBG was completely attenuated (p = 0.46) while the IL28B association remained significant (p = 0.0145), suggesting that CBG is probably not mediating the association between IL28B and SVR. These results are summarized in Table 2. 10.1371/journal.pone.0021854.t002Table 2 Statistical associations.

The CBG metaprotein included all (5 of 5) of the CBG peptides generated, as well as individual peptides from three other proteins (Figure 3). As expected, the correlation between all five of the CBG peptides is high (0.84<r<0.95) and correlations between CBG peptides and the AFAM, HEMO and APOB peptides are also high (0.57<r<0.94). Each of these component peptides was tested for association with IL28B genotype to determine whether all or only some of the peptides contributed to the association observed with the metaprotein (Table 3). All eight component peptides were found to be statistically significant, even with correction for multiple hypotheses (p≤0.006). 10.1371/journal.pone.0021854.g003 Figure 3 CBG metaprotein peptide composition.

Using this proteomic data, we were able to demonstrate a relationship between protein expression and genetic variation at the IL28B gene locus, a strong determinant of treatment-induced HCV clearance. Corticosteroid binding globulin peptides were strongly associated with IL28B genotype, accounting for over a third of the variance of the CBG metaprotein and thus, IL28B may be an important trans-pQTL for serum CBG levels among HCV-infected individuals. We were unable to show that CBG mediates the relationship between IL28B and treatment response, indicating possible pleiotropic effects of this locus.CBG, also known as Transcortin, is a major high-affinity plasma transport protein for glucocorticoids and progestins and is expressed primarily in the liver. Serum cortisol and CBG levels are inversely related [15], [16], thus, we would expect rs12979860-CC to associate with not only lower CBG but higher cortisol levels as well. Cortisol modulates the inflammatory response, and the primary function of CBG in proinflammatory states such as CHC infection is to deliver cortisol to sites of inflammation leading to down regulation of neutrophil activity and the cell mediated immune system. Treatment of CHC patients with interferon-beta has been linked to increases in both inflammatory cytokines and cortisol, but these effects appear to be independent [17]. Similarly, administration of interferon-alpha has been shown to alter plasma cortisol levels and immune cytokines, but these appear to be independent effects [18]. Based on our research, we postulate that the link between interferon and cortisol levels may hold for endogenous interferon lambda as well. Moreover, this relationship is unrelated to treatment response and thus, supports pleiotropic effects of interferons on the steroid hormone system and treatment response.Levels of serum CBG may be altered in chronic disease states, but are unlikely to confound our results. CBG levels may be reduced in patients with advanced stage liver disease [19]; however, no patients in this cohort had evidence of impaired hepatic function or decompensated disease. Moreover, both the IL28B rs12979860-CC responder genotype and advanced liver disease areas associated with lower CBG levels, but IL28B rs12979860-CC is not associated with a lower rate, but rather a more rapid rate of hepatic fibrosis in CHC patients [20]. In addition, in vitro studies have demonstrated an inhibitory effect of insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 on CBG mRNA expression in a human hepatoblastoma derived Hep G2 cell-line [21]. The inverse correlation between insulin and CBG has also been observed in small clinical studies [22] and upregulation of CBG has been proposed as a marker of type 1 diabetes mellitus [23]. The prevalence of insulin resistance is increased among patients with CHC infection and is associated with reduced virologic response to IFN-based therapy [24]. We did not specifically assess insulin resistance in our cohort. However, we found the IL28B rs12979860-C responder allele (and not the rs12979860-T ‘poor response’ allele that would be expected to associate with insulin resistance) to be associated with low serum levels of the CBG metaprotein.Despite strong statistical support for the observed association between IL28B and CBG in our study, the results were based on a relatively small number of patients and should thus be considered preliminary. Post-pubertal CBG levels do not vary significantly with age or gender, and there is minimal diurnal variation, thus reducing the potential influence of normal physiological variation on our observations [25]. Moreover, the generalizability of these findings, including whether this is a mechanism specific to infection with HCV, or an association with a chronic inflammatory state is unknown. Replication in larger cohorts will be necessary to validate and extend these findings. Studies that incorporate direct measures of cortisol and CBG may provide further validation of the relationship between IL28B genotype and corticosteroids.The current study utilized proteomic data generated by LC-MS/MS and analyzed using novel methods to group peptides into ‘metaprotein’ clusters. Thus, the intact proteins were not measured directly, but rather, specific groups of peptides representing the protein were measured. The metaprotein algorithm preferentially, but not exclusively, groups identified peptides according to their assigned “parent” protein. In addition, the algorithm permits exclusion of a peptide from the model if its expression trend does not track with the other peptides, and inclusion of peptides from different proteins or unidentified peptides which have expression in common with the metaprotein. In this way, future work correlating metaproteins with genes identified in pQTL analysis may assist in identification of currently unidentified proteins, or at least functional correlation of these unknown peptides with biological mechanisms.In summary, the current study used an open-proteomic platform to characterize protein expression associated with a polymorphism strongly associated with HCV clearance and have identified a strong trans-acting pQTL, providing insight into the biological consequences of this variation. We have found the CBG metaprotein and its constitutent peptides to be strongly associated with IL28B genotype, but not mediating the effect of IL28B genotype on treatment response. Our research showcases the power of pQTL analysis for the functional annotation of genetic variants."
