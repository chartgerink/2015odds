"Treatment response groups and adherence
Forty-three white Spanish patients met the inclusion criteria, 21 being responders and 22 non-responders. All patients were on treatment for the complete expected time and adherence to both drugs was overall >80%. No significant differences were observed between groups: 20 (95.2%) and 22 (100%) responders and non-responders had a good adherence to PegIFN-α, respectively (p = 0.488), and these proportions were 17 (80.9%) and 20 (90.9%) for RBV (p = 0.412). Baseline clinical variables associated with treatment outcome
Baseline clinical characteristics of patients according to treatment outcome and bivariate analyses results are shown in Table 1. Responder and non-responder groups were comparable in terms of gender, age, source of infection, and liver fibrosis stage (liver biopsy was not performed in 37.2% of the patients). Regarding body weight, one outlier was identified corresponding to a responder patient with 101.40 Kg, and differences between groups became significant when this patient was excluded (70.79±8.35 vs. 78.51±14.96 Kg in responder and non-responder groups, respectively p = 0.048). The alanine transaminase (ALT) quotient was significantly higher in responders than in non-responders (p = 0.009). Conversely, the gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) quotient tended to be higher in the non-responder group; two outliers were identified, which corresponded to two responder patients, and the GGT quotient was significantly higher in the non-responder group when these outliers were excluded (median, 0.58 and 1.07 in responders and non-responders, respectively, p = 0.033). The aspartate transaminase (AST) quotient was similar in both groups.

Baseline virological variables associated with treatment outcome HCV viral load
Viral load did not differ significantly between groups (p = 0.210), with a mean value of 5.75±0.86 Log(IU/ml) in responders, and 6.03±0.58 Log(IU/ml) in non-responders. E1–E2 genetic variability estimates
The median number of clones sequenced per patient was 22 (range, 20–33) in responders and 23 (range, 20–27) in non-responders (p = 0.291), yielding a total of 993 sequences. Genetic variability estimates according to treatment outcome and genomic region are shown in Table 2. Although non-responder patients tended to have higher values than those with SVR for most E1–E2 genetic variability estimates, the number of quasispecies variants (number of haplotypes, nHap) was the only factor that significantly differed between groups (p = 0.003). Regarding the hypervariable regions (HVR), the HVR-1 showed the highest values for all parameters; the nHap and the number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (Ks) in this region were marginally significant, both being higher in non-responders.

Phylogenetic analysis of the E1–E2 region
Differentiated clusters corresponding to responder and non-responder patients were not observed (Figure S1). Patients 1746 and 3468 appeared to be closely epidemiologically related since they shared a monophyletic clade with a 100% bootstrap support. In this clade, sequences from patient 1746 were a subgroup of those obtained from patient 3468, thus pointing to a source-recipient relationship. Patients 1634 and 3030, and 587 and 1313 might also be epidemiologically related, as inferred from the highly supported clade encompassing sequences from both patients in each group (100 and 90% bootstrap values, respectively), but no source-recipient relationship could be inferred. Analysis of amino acid composition of the E1–E2 region
None of the nine amino acid positions initially identified by VESPA analysis showed a significantly different composition between responders and non-responders after the false discovery rate correction was applied (data not shown). Analysis of amino acid composition of the Core region
VESPA analysis did not identify any amino acid position that differed between groups, although a polymorphism at position 70 was detected. On the other hand, when pairs of observed polymorphisms were subjected to bivariate analysis, the absence of both amino acids arginine (R) at position 70 and leucine (L) at position 91 was observed in 5 of 21 responder patients (23.8%) and in 12 of 22 non-responders (54.5%), (p = 0.039). R70 was substituted either by glutamine (Q) or histidine (H), and L91 mostly by methionine (M) and by cysteine (C) in one case. Since phylogenetic analysis showed that patients with this amino acid pattern did not group within the same cluster, the observed association was not attributed to sharing a common ancestry. This phylogenetic analysis provided similar evidence regarding to epidemiological relationships described for the E1–E2 region (data not shown). Prediction of the treatment outcome according to baseline host and virological variables Logistic regression analysis
Variables showing a p-value <0.2 in the bivariate analyses (gender, Sqrt(ALT quotient), Sqrt(GGT quotient), weight, Core amino acid pattern, nHap_E1–E2, Log(Ks_E1–E2), nHap_HVR-1, and Sqrt(Ks_HVR-1)) were initially considered; the nHap_E1–E2 and the Core amino acid pattern persisted in the final model (Text S1), with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.47 (95% confidence interval, CI95% = [1.16–1.87]) and 25.47 (CI95% = [2.52–257.74]), respectively. Thus, the absence of amino acids R70 and L91 and a higher nHap_E1–E2 significantly increased the risk for treatment failure. An area under the curve (AUC) of 0.8755 was obtained in the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (Figure 1), and selecting a 0.500 cut-off yielded a sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) of 81.0%, and a specificity and NPV of 81.8%.

Discriminant analysis
Two discriminant functions were obtained (Text S1) and cross-validated to assess how the results obtained would generalize to an independent but similar data set. Variables that persisted in Model 1 were: Core amino acid pattern, nHap_E1–E2, Sqrt(GGT quotient), Sqrt(ALT quotient), Log(viral load), Sqrt(total number of polymorphic sites in the HVR-2, S_HVR-2), body weight, and Log(Ks_E1–E2), in decreasing order of significance. The ROC curve obtained had an AUC of 0.9946 (Figure 1). This model yielded a 95.2% sensitivity and a 100% specificity (Table 3); however, sensitivity decreased to 76.2% and specificity to 72.7% after cross-validation. Therefore, we developed model 2 including the Core amino acid pattern, nHap_E1–E2, Sqrt(GGT quotient), Sqrt(ALT quotient), nHap_HVR-1, and Sqrt(Ks_HVR-1), and body weight, in decreasing order of significance. The AUC of the corresponding ROC curve was 0.9697 (Figure 1). Treatment outcome was predicted with 90.5% sensitivity and 95.5% specificity (cut-off, 0.550), and these values remained high after the cross-validation (85.7% and 81.8%, respectively). Besides, the model could be optimized to correctly identify most responder patients by choosing a cut-off of 0.900, so that treatment is not denied to individuals that are likely to respond (NPV, 93.3% after cross-validation). Sensitivity, specificity, NPV and PPV for different cut-offs are shown in Table 3. According to cross-validation, in an independent but similar data set, treatment could be omitted in 63.6 to 81.8% of the non-responder patients while most patients likely to respond would be identified and treated.

Although several factors have been identified as predictors of treatment outcome, none of them can provide a reliable individualized prediction when used independently. Based on our results in Spanish patients infected with HCV-1b, we propose the use of discriminant statistical models based on host and viral characteristics to provide an aggregate prediction of the treatment outcome at baseline.Among the host-related factors studied baseline ALT levels, which are an indicator of liver damage, were significantly higher in responder patients than in non-responders (p = 0.009), as previously reported [11], [12]. Conversely, the GGT quotient tended to be higher in the non-responder group in agreement with other studies [12], [23]; higher GGT levels have been related to advanced fibrosis, steatosis and insuline resistance, which are more common among non-responders [24]. The body weight tended to be higher in non-responder patients; in fact, it has been suggested that obese subjects have an increased expression of the IFN-α signalling inhibitor factor SOCS-3 [25]. Some of the host factors that have previously been associated with treatment failure, such as male gender, advanced age, advanced liver fibrosis stage and cirrhosis [6], [7], [13] did not reach statistical significance in our study probably due to a limited sample size, especially regarding the liver biopsy, which was not performed in 37.2% of patients.In relation to virus-related factors, HCV baseline viral load has been suggested as a predictor of SVR, but several cut-offs have been proposed [24]. In our study, average viral loads were higher in non-responders but differences were not significant. Additionally, several studies have reported an association between the level of variability in the HCV genome at baseline and treatment outcome. Envelope glycoprotein coding regions are highly variable; the HVR-1, which is the most variable region in the whole genome, is targeted by host neutralizing antibodies and plays a role in immune escape [26]. While the variability in this region has also been associated with treatment outcome [27]–[32], discrepancies on this matter have been noted probably due to the different treatment regimens, the different genetic variability estimates employed, and limitations in statistical analyses [33]–[35]. While our results show that treatment outcome was not related to the presence of a common evolutionary origin, in general terms, the E1–E2 genetic variability estimators suggested that a high heterogeneity in the baseline viral population could be involved in combination therapy failure, either through the pre-existence or the generation of drug-resistant viral variants. A higher number of quasispecies variants in the E1–E2 region (nHap_E1–E2) was significantly associated with treatment failure (p = 0.003). Additionally, when the analysis focussed on the HVR-1 subregion, nHap and Ks were marginally significant with higher values in the non-responder group. Although significant differences between groups at the amino acid level were not found, synonymous substitutions may have an effect on the secondary structure of the genomic RNA, which is an important selection target [36].Pre-treatment Core amino acid substitutions at positions 70 (R by Q) and/or 91 (L by M) have been described as useful independent predictors of treatment failure in Japanese HCV-1b infected patients [37]. Similarly, our results show an association between the absence of both R70 and L91 amino acids and treatment failure (p = 0.039). Although it has been suggested that the Core protein may inhibit the transcription of antiviral genes induced by IFN-α [38], further studies are needed to clarify the role of the observed amino acid substitutions in treatment failure.Since factors that significantly differed between groups in the bivariate analyses were not completely reliable in predicting treatment outcome when used independently, we developed predictive models that included a combination of variables. The logistic regression analysis identified the nHap_E1–E2 (OR = 1.47) and the Core amino acid pattern (OR = 25.47) as independent risk factors for treatment failure. However, predictive models obtained by discriminant analysis including additional variables showed better AUC values and more accurate predictions in our study population (90.5–95.2% sensitivity and 95.5–100% specificity). The most significant variables in both discriminant models were the Core amino acid pattern, nHap_E1–E2, and GGT and ALT quotients. Although prediction accuracy may deteriorate in an independent sample, the internal cross-validation pointed to a better reproducibility for model 2 in a comparable population (identifying 85.7% and 81.8% of the responder and non-responder patients, respectively), despite the fact that model 1 best predicted treatment outcome in our population. Besides, using model 2 the detection of those patients likely to respond to therapy could be maximized by adjusting the cut-off, leading to a higher NPV at the cost of a lower specificity (93.3% and 63.6%, respectively, after cross-validation). Thus, the results suggest that non-response could be predicted at baseline with high accuracy (NPV after cross-validation of 81.8% to 93.3% depending on the cut-off) in patient groups comparable to ours in terms of ethnicity, clinical background, and HCV subtype.To our knowledge, this is the first study that describes a model for predicting individual combination therapy outcomes on the basis of baseline host and viral characteristics using a discriminant multivariate analysis. This comprehensive statistical method integrates the information of all variables included in the model thus improving the prediction with respect to more commonly used statistical approaches. Additionally, discriminant models may be adjusted to include the most significant predictors of treatment outcome in each population. However, our study has several limitations: i) other viral genome regions not included in the study might also be involved in resistance to therapy, such as the ISDR. Nevertheless, a meta-analysis suggested that the association between the number of mutations in this region and SVR achievement was more pronounced in Japanese than in European patients [39]. As most European HCV-1b strains present less than 3 mutations, large sample sizes would be required to find significant associations; ii) recent studies have suggested that single nucleotide polymorphisms in several human genes involved in the IFN mediated response are associated to treatment outcome in HCV-1 infected patients, especially the IL28B gene polymorphisms [14]–[18]. Since our study was retrospective, whole-blood samples were not available to assess host genetic polymorphisms; iii) the sample size was limited to 43 patients. However, a similar number of patients were included in each group, accounting for the fact that about 50% of patients infected by HCV-1b achieve an SVR. Although an independent but similar population was not available, we performed an internal cross-validation. This method is commonly used to reduce classification bias and estimate future model performance [40].Our results show that both host and viral factors are involved in treatment failure, although the exact mechanisms should be further characterized. The host-related variables included in the prediction models are routinely used for patient management and relatively easy to obtain, while viral variability estimates are obtained through laborious methods. Even so, and if confirmed in further studies, the information obtained may help physicians to restrict treatment to those patients that are likely to benefit from it, thus reducing overall treatment costs. Those patients that are unlikely to respond could avoid current therapy and related side effects, and wait for more effective treatment regimens.In conclusion, discriminant analysis using both baseline HCV genetic variability and host characteristics has been shown as a useful statistical tool allowing us to accurately predict combination treatment outcome in a high proportion of Spanish HCV-1b infected patients. Further studies including host genetic polymorphisms and larger numbers of patients are under way, and similarly generated models will probably have an increased predictive power."
