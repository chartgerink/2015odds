"No evidence found for the human SNPs associated with HCV clearance in chimpanzees In humans, spontaneous as well as treatment-induced clearance was found to be associated with a series of SNPs upstream of the IL-28B gene [4]–[6], [8], [10]. To assess whether clearance of HCV in chimpanzees is associated with the same SNPs, genotype analysis of chimpanzee DNA was performed for rs8099917 and rs12979860. The SNP rs8099917 consistently showed thymidine at this position on both chromosomes, indicating that all animals tested were homozygous rs8099917-TT carriers. In humans rs8099917-T is the preferred allele associated with HCV clearance. In addition, the chimpanzees were also genotyped for the rs12979860 SNP, and again no evidence was found for variance at this position. All animals tested had homozygous rs12979860-TT genotypes. In humans, the rs12979860-T allele is the so-called risk-allele associated with an increased risk for viral persistence. Thus, both IL-28B associated human SNPs are not present in chimpanzees. Chimpanzees possess a unique sequence near the IL-28B gene Since rs8099917 and rs12979860 genotyping was performed by sequencing, the neighboring nucleotide sequences are also known, allowing us to compare this region with documented human genome sequences (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, USA). Two different haplotypes were observed near rs12979860, HE599784 and HE599785. Notable was the strong uneven distribution: 62 out of 63 animals were heterozygous, carrying both HE599784 and HE599785. Only one animal was found to be homozygous for HE599785. These data suggest that an as yet unknown balancing selection may be operative on this region. No detectable IFNλ in serum from chimpanzees In humans carrying the rs12979860-TT genotype, significant lower serum levels of IFNλ were documented in chronically infected patients as compared to patients with resolved infections [19], [20]. To investigate whether this difference could also be observed in chimpanzees, ELISA was performed on sera from chronically infected animals and animals that cleared the infection. Using commercially available immunoassays designed to detect human IL-28A/B and IL-29, we were unable to detect IFNλ in sera from any of the chimpanzees tested, neither in animals chronically infected with HCV nor animals that spontaneously cleared the infection. In the same assays, IL-28A/B and IL-29 could be detected in sera from patients with chronic HCV infection (data not shown; detection limit of the assays: 62.5 pg/ml and 8 pg/ml, respectively). IP-10 levels in serum correlate with viral load in HCV infected chimpanzees, but not in humans To investigate whether the IP-10 levels in serum were associated with viral clearance, we compared IP-10 levels of chronically infected animals with a high HCV load (>200,000 IU/ml), low HCV load (<200,000 IU/ml), chimpanzees that had resolved HCV infection early after experimental exposure, and a group of HCV-naïve, non-exposed chimpanzees. As shown in Figure 1(a), the IP-10 levels in sera of animals with a high viral load were significantly higher relative to animals in the other groups. The serum IP-10 levels of animals with low viremia, animals that resolved the infection and HCV-naïve animals were relatively low and comparable between these groups. 10.1371/journal.pone.0046645.g001 Figure 1 Correlation between HCV viremia and IP-10 in serum in chimpanzees. Box-whisker plots indicate the interquartile range and the median (horizontal line) of IP-10 concentrations in serum from animals of the different groups; “high HCV load” where the virus load of individual animal is higher as compared to median value of 200,000 IU/ml; “low HCV load” where the virus load of individual animal is lower as compared to the median value of 200,000 IU/ml; HCV resolvers and naïve, non-exposed (A). Box-whisker plots indicate the interquartile range and the median (horizontal line) of IP-10 concentrations in serum of humans and chimpanzees with high HCV load (>median virus load) and low HCV load (<median virus load) (B) and IP-10 concentrations plotted against HCV-RNA load in serum from chimpanzees and humans (C). A significant correlation between the two parameters is defined as r2>0.85 and p<0.05 where “r2” is a measure for correlation and “p” is a measure for the quality if this correlation. Earlier studies in chronically infected patients demonstrated an association between viral load and IP-10 levels in serum [21], [22]. Therefore, we evaluated whether this correlation also existed in chimpanzees. As shown in Figure 1(b), at a low viral load, the IP-10 levels were similar in humans and chimpanzees. In contrast, serum IP-10 levels were higher in chimpanzees with a high viral load relative to human patients with similar high viral loads. A strong correlation between serum IP-10 concentration and viral load was observed in chronically infected chimpanzees. In contrast to chimpanzees, neither a correlation was observed in the overall group of patients chronically infected with HCV (Figure 1(c)), nor when this group was divided into subgroups according to their rs12979860 genotype (data not shown). Serum IP-10 concentrations correlate with γGT in HCV infected chimpanzees, but not in humans In patients, the concentration of the serum aminotransferase ALT is used as indicator of active damaging processes in the liver during chronic HCV infection. However, in chimpanzees, γGT tends to be more increased rather than ALT. We therefore assessed whether IP-10 levels in blood correlated with the liver enzymes γGT, ALT and AST in chronically HCV infected chimpanzees and patients. As shown in Figure 2(a), in chimpanzees the serum levels of IP-10 strongly correlated with γGT (r2 = 0.91 and p<0.0001), while no correlation was observed between IP-10 and either ALT (r2 = 0.58; p = 0.0007) or AST (r2 = 0.17; p = 0.11). In contrast, in HCV infected patients, no correlations were observed between serum IP-10 and the aminotransferases (Figure 2(b)). Direct comparison of the levels of ALT and AST in serum of patients and chimpanzees demonstrated that only moderate ALT values were observed in chimpanzees, whereas 4 out of 58 patients exceeded an ALT value of 200 U/ml which is more then 4 times the maximum reference value for healthy humans and chimpanzees (Figure 3). Similarly, also AST levels were only moderately increased in chimpanzees, whereas 11 patients exceeded the maximum reference value by threefold. In contrast, serum γGT levels were found to be substantially elevated in some individuals from both species: in 3 out of 16 chimpanzees and 7 out of 60 patients, the γGT levels exceeded 200 U/ml, which is more then 5 times its reference value in healthy humans and chimpanzees. 10.1371/journal.pone.0046645.g002 Figure 2 Relation between IP-10 levels and aminotransferases in serum. Relation between IP-10 and liver enzymes γGT, ALT and AST from HCV-infected individual chimpanzees (A) and HCV-infected patients (B) A significant correlation between the two parameters is defined as r2>0.85 and p<0.05 where “r2” is a measure for correlation and “p” is a measure for the quality if this correlation. 10.1371/journal.pone.0046645.g003 Figure 3 γGT, ALT and AST in humans and chimpanzees chronically infected with HCV. Interquartile range and the median (horizontal line) of γGT, ALT and AST in U/ml in chimpanzees and patients chronically infected with HCV. In humans, HCV clearance is associated with specific IL-28B gene polymorphisms as well as the levels of specific ISG, such as IP-10 [4], [5], [7], [8], [10], [13]. It has been suggested that these pathways are associated with one another in humans [11], [19] although the interrelating mechanism is still unknown. The work presented here was designed to assess whether a potential correlation between IFNλ and polymorphism near the IL-28B gene can be studied in chimpanzees.In humans, genetic variation near the IL-28B gene is associated with spontaneous as well as treatment-induced clearance of HCV [4], [5], [8], [10]. In chimpanzees, we found no evidence for these human SNPs and therefore it is unlikely that these specific SNPs play a role during HCV infection in chimpanzees. Instead, all animals tested were found to be homozygous carriers for rs12979860-TT and rs8099917-TT, which is in line with recently reported data on chimpanzees from another primate center [23]. A potential explanation may be that HCV is regarded as a human disease as no documentation is available on wild chimpanzees infected with HCV. In that respect different evolutionary selective pressure may have caused differences in innate responses between both species.Since the documented SNPs, rs12979860 and rs8099917 are located in an intergenic region rather than within gene-encoding regions of the DNA, there may be a link between the region where the SNPs are located and another, yet unspecified gene. Given the fact that humans and chimpanzees share a common ancestor, the chimpanzee sequence likely represents the ancestral genotypes. This is in line with the finding that Central and Western African human populations carry the rs12979860-TT genotype at high frequency [10].Even though humans and chimpanzees show 98.8% identity at the DNA level [24], many SNPs identified in humans are not necessarily present in chimpanzees. Although no evidence was found in chimpanzees for the two SNPs with documented relevance during HCV infection in humans, additional polymorphism near the IL-28B gene was detected. In the animals tested, a remarkable level of heterozygous carriers was observed, which may suggest a balancing selection being operative on this region. Our findings cannot be explained by the breeding strategy as concluded on the basis of variation in the mtDNA [25], and because it was also observed in animals from outside the BPRC breeding colony. The underlying mechanism responsible for this heterogeneity to assure a genetically diverse population is unknown.In serum from chimpanzees no IFNλ was detected, and therefore no conclusion could be drawn from its effect on the outcome of HCV infection in chimpanzees. IFNλ has been measured in chimpanzees before using human detection reagents [23]. Given the rapid normalization of IFNλ levels in chimpanzees shortly after infection, it is expected that IFNλ is too low to detect during the chronic phase of infection. Lower IFNλ levels in chimpanzees could not be explained by a different copy number of the IFNλ-encoding genes as both in humans as well as chimpanzees only one copy of each of the IL-29/IL28A and IL-28B genes was observed (human and chimpanzee database supported by National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, USA).In patients chronically infected with HCV, low baseline IP-10 levels are predictive for successful treatment-induced clearance [7]. Our data show that IP-10 levels are higher in chronically infected chimpanzees relative to patients. This finding is in line with the suggestion that HCV infection causes stronger upregulation of ISGs in chimpanzees as compared to humans [18]. Furthermore, based on data from a limited number of animals with high HCV-RNA levels, it was suggested that the failure of chimpanzees to respond successfully to IFN-based antiviral treatment was due to high baseline activation of the IFN-system. Based on our data it is to be expected that peripheral IP-10 levels from the animals in the Lanford-study are high. Given the documented correlation between high IP-10 and limited treatment success in humans, it is tempting to speculate that chimpanzees with a high HCV load and subsequently high baseline IP-10 levels in serum are indeed equivalent to human non-responders to IFN-based therapy. However, this implies that animals with lower IP-10 may respond to IFN-based therapy.As humans and chimpanzees do not to show the same variation near the IL-28B gene, we were not able to confirm the earlier documented association between IL-28B variation and γGT levels in humans [17]. We did however find a correlation between γGT, IP-10 and virus load. This may imply, interrelating mechanisms play a role in both humans and chimpanzees, but that species-specific factors may contribute to biochemical differences between both species. Conclusion Our data show that although chimpanzees do not possess the SNP near the IL-28B gene that are associated with HCV outcome in humans, chimpanzees do show genetic variation in this region. Furthermore, we found a positive correlation between IP-10 and viral load as well as γGT in chimpanzees, which was not found in patients. This difference may reflect the heterogeneous characteristics of HCV induced reactions in the liver of both species. The correlation between IP-10, virus load and γGT may reflect the lack of confounding factors in chimpanzees, since heavy alcohol intake, diabetes and obesity are known to influence the progression of HCV infection in humans, but not in chimpanzees."
