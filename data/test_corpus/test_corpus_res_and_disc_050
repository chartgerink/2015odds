"Patients
Baseline characteristics of the 111 patients studied are presented in Table 1. Patients are mainly male (n = 70 in the total group). The mean age at liver biopsy was 47.1 years. Genotypes were represented as follows with 51.2%, 10.8%, 13% and 23.2% of patients with respectively genotypes 1, 2, 3 and 4, in the total group of patients. Genotypes 1 and 4 are the most frequent in patients followed at Beaujon Hospital.
Patients from the screen group (n = 28) had mainly mild (F1) (n = 11) and moderate (F2) fibrosis (n = 16). In the screen group, patients with more advanced fibrosis were excluded to avoid identification of miRNAs that may be rather associated with advanced fibrosis than with response to PEG-IFN plus ribavirin. In the validation group, 23, 24, 17 and 17 patients were respectively F1, F2, F3 and F4. The fibrosis stage was unknown for 2 patients. Out of the 111 patients, 57 were SVR, 36 NR and 18 RR.
In the total group (excluding RR patients), Gamma-glutamyltransferase (per IU/L increase, OR = 0.991; 95% CI: 0.986–0.997; p = 0.0040), HCV viral load (per log10 cp/ml increase, OR = 0.311; 95% CI: 0.145–0.675; p = 0.0032) and HVC genotype 1 (vs. others, OR = 0.093; 95% CI: 0.020–0.444; p = 0.0029) were associated with lower rates of SVR. Moreover, IFNL3 rs12979860 TT genotype was associated with NR (vs. CC or CT, OR = 0.271; 95%:CI 0.101–0.729; p = 0.0097). MiRNAs expression Global miRNA approach.
Out of the 851 miRNAs studied, 20 were particularly deregulated (confidence levels greater than 95% (p < 0.05) and a fold between the two population more than 2 or a confidence level greater than 99% (p<0.01) between NRs and SVRs, in the screen group) (Fig. 1A and Table 2A). Four out of the 20 miRNAs selected showed the same deregulation of expression in the screen group and the validation group (Fig. 1B and Table 2B). Mir-99a, mir-181a* and mir-23a were down-regulated in NRs whereas mir-217 was accumulated in NRs compared to SVRs.
The OR were calculated for each of the 4 miRNAs, 3 were statistically significant (mir-99a, mir-181a* and mir-23a) (Fig. 2). The AUC of the model consisting in the combination of mir-99a, mir-181a* and mir-23a was 0.7346 (Fig. 2A). The sensibility, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of each miRNAs and the model combining the 3 miRNAs are represented on Fig. 2B. 10.1371/journal.pone.0121395.g001

Total RNAs was extracted and analyzed for miRNAs content by RT q-PCR. The ΔCt for each miRNA was calculated and normalized to the ΔCt value of SNORD44, in each biopsy. The histograms represent the mean expression of miRNAs/SNORD44 within the groups of patients NRs, SVRs and RRs normalized to the expression of the same miRNA within the group of normal patients. The association of miRNAs expression with viral response was calculated using the Wald test. 1A- Out of 851 miRNAs, 20 miRNAs were particularly deregulated between NRs and SVRs in the screen group (p<0.05 with at least a 2-fold difference between NRs and SVRs or p<0.01). 1B- The expression of the 20 miRNAs previously selected was assessed by RT q-PCR, in the validation group, independently.

In our study, mir-122 was neither significantly decreased in NRs compared to SVRs in the screen group (p = 0.077) nor in the total group (p = 0.06) (Fig. 2C). None of the miRNAs regulating HCV replication in vitro (mir-196b p = 0.499, mir-296-5p p = 0.253, mir-431 p = 0.128, mir-448 p = 0.971) showed difference of expression prior to treatment, in NRs and SVRs (Fig. 2C). The expression of mir-296-5p (p = 0.002), mir-122 (p<0.001), mir-448 (p<0.001) and mir-128 (p<0.001) was significantly down-regulated in patients with chronic hepatitis C compared to normal non-infected patients (Fig. 2C).
The expression of mir-23a, mir-99a, mir-181a*, mir-217 and mir-122 was investigated, in 68 serum samples available (NR = 26, RR = 10, RR = 32) (Fig. 3). The level of expression of mir-23a and mir-99a were low compared to mir-122 (Fig. 3A). None of mir-23a, mir-99a and mir-122 was differentially expressed between SVRs and NRs (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, only serum mir-122 and alanine amino transferase were strongly correlated (Fig. 3B), as we previously described [23]. Mir-217 and mir-181a* were not detected efficiently in our serum samples (Fig. 3). Moreover, the expression of mir-23a, mir-99a and mir-122 were not correlated in serum and liver samples (Table 3). 10.1371/journal.pone.0121395.g003

From the 30 mRNAs tested 25 were deregulated between NRs and SVRs (Fig. 4A and Table 4). Interestingly all the ISGs assessed were accumulated in NRs compared to SVRs (Fig. 4A and Table 4). The ORs were calculated for each mRNAs (Table 4).
ISGs were particularly over-expressed in rs12979860 TT (16.125 to 2.07 fold Fig. 4B and S2A and S2B Tables) patients compared to CC (Fig. 4B). The 3 co-receptors of HCV entry occludin (OCLN) CD81 molecule (CD81) and claudin 1 (CLDN1) were only accumulated in NRs compared to SVRs and not in IFNL3 TT compared to CC patients (Table 4 and S2 Table). 10.1371/journal.pone.0121395.g004

The clinical and biological data, IFNL3 polymorphism, mRNAs and miRNAs expression were analyzed by multivariate analysis. IFNL3 polymorphism was not independent of ISGs expression (S3 Table). ISGs were particularly over-expressed in NRs compared to SVRs. It is likely that ISGs expression is a stronger predictor than IFNL3 SNPs, considering the results of multivariate analysis. Mir-99a (per unit of relative mir-99a expression increase OR = 6.053 95% CI: 1.897–19.314 p = 0.0024) IFI35 (per unit of relative IFI35 expression increase OR = 0.069 95% CI:0.013–0.361 p = 0.0015) and HCV genotype 1 (vs. other genotypes OR = 0.093 95% CI: 0.020–0.444 p = 0.0029) were combined in a model predictor of SVR (Fig. 5A). The details about the selection of the variables in the multivariate analysis are presented in S3 Table. Overall the variables included in the multivariate analysis only mir-99a, IFI35 and HCV genotype 1 were independent predictors of SVR (p = 0.0051 p = 0.0011 and p = 0.0059 respectively Wald test) (Fig. 5B). Interestingly the model predicts SVR with a positive predictive value of 86.54% (and a negative predictive value of 71.8%), a sensibility of 80% and a specificity of 80.4%. In patients infected with genotype 1 both IFI35 and mir-99a expression were important to predict SVR. However, in patients infected with either genotype 2, 3, 4 or 5, IFI35 expression alone was a predictor of SVR (Fig. 5C). 10.1371/journal.pone.0121395.g005

Clinical, miRNAs and mRNAs expression data were analyzed by multivariate analysis. 5A- ORs are presented for the 3 variables of the signature: mir-99a, IFI35 and HCV genotype 1. 5B- Receiver Operator Curves for prediction of viral response of the signature (AUC 0.876) (genotype 1, IFI35 and mir-99a expression) based on IFI35 expression (AUC 0.777) and mir-99a (AUC 0.688). 5C- Schematic representation of the prediction of SVR. Patients with genotype non-1 had high SVR rates when they express low level of IFI35 (l for low, < mean IFI35 expression). HCV genotype 1 infected patients with low level of IFI35 and high level of mir-99a (h for high, > mean mir-99a expression) showed high SVR rates. For the identification of mir-99a, in the screen group, we use of a validation procedure on an independent sample prevented inflation of type I error and false discovery rate. A simple calculation under the hypothesis that all 20 miRNAs detected in the screening stage were false positive findings (a conservative scenario) showed that the likelihood of 4 (or more) false positive results on the validation sample (using a type I error at 5%) was 1.6%. In other words, it was unlikely to observe 4 miRNAs detected on the validation stage if all miRNAs detected on the test stage were false positive. Further analysis showed that only mir-99a was an independent predictor of SVR and mir-99a was integrated in the signature to predict SVR, with a p-Value of 0.0051 in multivariate analysis. We are confident that this result is unlikely related to inflation of type I error. However, further analysis will be needed to confirm the role of mir-99a in the prediction of SVR. Identification of miRNAs associated with SVR
The major novelty of our work consists in the identification of 4 miRNAs (mir-23a, mir-99a, mir-181a*, and mir-217) differentially expressed between NRs and SVRs.
The expression of mir-23a, mir-99a and mir-181a* was increased in SVRs compared to NRs. However, mir-217 was reduced in SVRs compared to NRs. Previous reports described hepatic expression of mir-99a, mir-23a and mir-181a suggesting processing of the pre-Mir and co-expression of mir-181a* [31–33]. Interestingly, in malignant cells, whereas the expression of some miRNAs is increased, the widespread under-expression of miRNAs is a more common phenomenon [34]. The modification of miRNAs expression profile might suggest that in NRs, hepatic cells may be more likely to undergo malignant process than in SVRs.
Interestingly, Mir-217 has been described as an oncogene [35] and a reduction of mir-99a expression has been reported in HCC tissues [31]. Moreover, restoration of mir-99a, in vitro, dramatically suppressed HCC cell growth by inducing G1 phase cell cycle arrest [31]. Mir-99a is increased during TGFB-induced epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) [36]. Since EMT is involved during liver fibrogenesis, the expression of mir-99a may increase during fibrosis. Surprisingly, in our cohort, the expression of mir-99a is reduced in F2-F4 vs. F1 (p = 0.028) and in F3-F4 vs. F1F2 (p = 0.035) (S1 Fig). The EMT, in the liver may not induce a reduction of mir-99a expression. The reduction of mir-99a in NRs and at later stages of fibrosis may indicate that these two groups of patients have a higher risk to develop HCC.
The over-expression of mir-23a has been described in mouse models developing non-alcoholic steato-hepatitis, and HCC [32]. Moreover, mir-23a down-regulates interleukin-6 receptor [37] whereas high level of circulating IL-6 has been associated with NR [38]. The modulation of mir23a expression may regulate IL6 signalling in patients with CHC.
Interestingly, hepatic mir-181a* was up regulated in patients with SVR compared to NRs after PEG-IFN/RBV therapy [39]. This result supports our data and strongly suggest an up-regulation of mir-181a* expression in patients with SVRs.
Only few putative mRNAs targets of mir-23a, mir-217, mir-99a and mir-181a* have been described, so far. A deeper analysis of these miRNAs activity may help to elucidate the mechanisms of NR to IFN-based therapy.
A previous study investigating the modification of miRNAs expression, didn’t report the same set of miRNAs associated with SVR [16]. However, the authors didn’t validate their results using an independent group of patients and included only patients with Japanese ancestry [16]. These discrepancies may explain the identification of different miRNAs associated with SVR.
Mir-122 showed a trend of down-regulation in NRs. In a previous work, we reported a reduction of mir-122 in NRs plus RRs as compared to SVRs patients [23]. In agreement, in the current cohort, when RRs were added to the group of NRs, the difference of mir-122 expression between SVRs and NRs plus RRs was statistically significant (p = 0.02).
MiR-196, miR-296-5p, miR-431 and miR-448 are all induced by IFN α/β and contain putative recognition sites within HCV genome [17]. Whereas ISGs were significantly accumulated in NRs, no difference of expression of IFN-induced miRNAs was observed. Interestingly, this data raises the hypothesis that activation of miRNAs induced by IFN and ISGs, in NRs, may involve different signalling pathways.
In the serum, the level of expression of mir-23a and mir-99a were low compared to the one of mir-122 (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, serum mir-99a was down-regulated in patients with HCV compared to normal controls and patients with chronic hepatitis B [40]. This discrepancy may explain the low level of serum mir-99a detected in our cohort. Circulating mir-23a was suggested to be associated with type 2 diabetes [41]. However, in our cohort, none of the patients for whom serum was available, had diabetes. So we were unable to investigate this association. Interestingly, mir-122 was expressed in the serum and strongly correlates with Alanine amino transferase (Fig. 3B), confirming our previous results [23]. The levels of expression of mir-217 and mir-181a* were too low to be detected efficiently (Fig. 3A). To our knowledge, there are no study that reported efficient detection of serum mir-217 and mir-181a* in human serum samples. Analysis of mRNAs associated with response
All the ISGs studied were over-expressed in NRs, prior to treatment (Fig. 4A and Table 4). IFI35 is involved in the antiviral functions of IFN against viral infections. The over-expression of IFI35 suppresses the activation of IFNβ and ISG56 promoters [42]. Interestingly, in patients with NR, the higher expression of IFI35 may limit the efficacy of PEG-IFN to activate the expression of ISGs.
An interesting additional finding was the association of ISGs expression with the unfavourable T allele of rs12979860 IFNL3 (Fig. 4B and S2A and S2B Tables), as it was previously described [43–45]. Several studies reported that intra-hepatic ISGs expression is a better predictor of SVR than IFNL3 polymorphisms [44,45]. The expression of a set of 3 ISGs (ISG15, IFI27 and IFI6) has been associated with rs12979860 SNPs [46]. IFNL3 polymorphisms have been suggested to be associated with a specific cell-type modulation of ISGs expression (MxA, PKR, OAS1 and ISG15) in hepatic cells and PBMCs [43]. Predictive signature of SVR
We identified a signature combining the hepatic expression 3 miRNAs (mir-23a, mir-99a and mir-181a*) to predict SVR (AUC: 0.7346) (Fig. 2A). In our study, the accumulation of intra-hepatic ISGs expression, prior to treatment was more highly associated with NR than with IFNL3 rs12979860 TT genotype. The multivariate analysis of all clinical and biological data, miRNAs and mRNAs expression and IFNL3 SNPs, allowed us to build a signature (IFI35, mir-99a and HCV genotype) which is associated with a high predictive positive value (86.54%), sensibility (80%) and specificity (80.4%). None of the miRNAs identified showed a correlation between its hepatic and its serum expression (Table 3). Therefore, the expression of mir-99a alone or both mir-23a, mir-99a and mir-181a* has to be assessed in the liver, to provide enough information to predict SVR.
In a multivariable regression model, studying a HCV genotype 1 cohort, IFNL3 rs12979860 CC genotype was the strongest pre-treatment predictor of SVR (OR = 5.2; 95% CI: 4.1–6.7) with only a sensitivity of 56%, a specificity of 79%, a positive predictive value of 69% and a negative predictive value of 68% [47]. Accordingly, in our cohort, IFNL3 alone showed only moderate accuracy to predict SVR. The predictive value of IFNL3 polymorphism is stronger in HCV genotypes 1 and 4 than in genotypes 2 and 3 [10,48]. Therefore, in our cohort combining all genotypes, the accuracy of IFNL3 may be reduced. The combination of mir-99a, IFI35 expression and HCV genotype was a higher predictive factor, at baseline, than IFNL3 polymorphism (Fig. 5).
In the current cohort (111 patients) both the 3-miRNAs-signature (AUC = 0.74) and the multi-variable signature (AUC = 0.876) showed higher accuracy to predict SVR than the 2-ISGs-signature (IFI27 and CXCL9) previously described by our group (AUC = 0.713) [6].
An independent study reported a 4-ISGs-signature (IFI27, GIP3/ISG15, RSAD2 and HTATIP2) as stronger predictor of SVR than IFNL3 SNPs [44]. However, the authors only investigated the expression of 8 selected mRNAs in a single group of patients without any validation set [44].
Whereas major improvements have been achieved in the treatment of CHC with the development of DAAs, PEG-IFN and ribavirin remains an option for many patients worldwide. Therefore the prediction of responsiveness to PEG-IFN plus ribavirin remains an important issue. The assessment of the hepatic expression of mir-99a and IFI35 may help to discriminate patients with low chance to respond to PEG-IFN plus ribavirin. In clinical practice, performing a liver biopsy remains useful to stage fibrosis [49], since urgent initiation of treatment is recommended for patients with advanced fibrosis or compensated cirrhosis. Performing different tests (stage fibrosis and predict treatment response) on the same liver biopsy could optimize the use of this invasive procedure. Patients with low chance to respond to PEG-IFN plus ribavirin may be candidates for IFN-free regimen."
