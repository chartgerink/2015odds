"One hundred and thirty six asymptomatic HTLV-1-infected subjects and 93 HAM/TSP patients were studied. The mean age of the study population was 52 years, and 154 (67.25%) were female (Table 1). Sexual risks of transmission were not different for HAM/TSP and asymptomatic patients. IL28B genotype distribution at the SNP rs12979860 in HTLV-1 patients was as follows: CC (n = 68; 30.49%), CT (n = 139, 62.33%) and TT (n = 16; 7.17%), six patients had no DNA enough to carried out the tests (Table 1). Median HTLV-1 DNA proviral load (PVL) from asymptomatic HTLV-1 subjects was 36 copies, whereas the PVL median from HAM/TSP patients was 236 copies/104 PBMC. Furthermore, the IL28B CT genotype was more frequent in HAM/TSP patients than in asymptomatic carriers (p = 0.1067). IL28B genotype distribution at the SNP rs8099917 was: TT (n = 144, 64.0%), GT (n = 63, 28.0%) and GG (n = 18; 8.0%), four patients had no DNA enough to carried out the tests (Table1). TT genotype was more frequent in HAM/TSP patients when compared to asymptomatic carriers (p = 0.2879). Bivariate analysis revealed that the proviral load was significantly associated with HAM/TSP (p<0.01) as well as with the polymorphisms SNP rs8099917 in the profile GG (p<0.01) and SNP rs12979860 in the profile CT (p = 0.01) (Table 1).10.1371/journal.pntd.0003199.t001Table 1

<0.01 SNP: Single nucleotide polymorphism.*Four patients without enough samples for IL28b rs8099917 assay.**Six patients without enough samples for IL28b rs12979860 assay.A multivariate model analysis, including gender, age, and HTLV-1 DNA proviral load, showed that IL28B polymorphisms were independently associated with HAM/TSP outcome in rs12979860 genotype CT (OR = 2.03; IC95% = 0.96–4.27) and in rs8099917 genotype GG (OR = 7.61; IC95% = 1.82–31.72). In this model, age was also significantly associated with the outcome when included as a continuous variable (Table 2). Results of the x2 test for “Goodness of Fit” were x2 22.52, p<0.0001 for SNP rs12979860, and x2 7.63, p = 0.005 for SNP rs8099917, revealing that deviation existed in the Hardy Weinberg equilibrium.10.1371/journal.pntd.0003199.t002Table 2

<0.01 SNP: Single nucleotide polymorphism.The neuropathology of HAM/TSP provides evidence that immune mediated mechanisms may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of the disease [14], [16]. A few studies have looked for a possible association between Il28B polymorphisms – rs8099917 and rs12979860 and HAM/TSP outcome, while examining the HTLV-1 proviral load as a confounder; those who did have reported controversial results [17][9], [18]. The major finding of this study, so far, was the independent association of IL28B polymorphism SNP rs8099917 (GG) with the development of HAM/TSP when compared to asymptomatic HTLV-1 carriers. To our knowledge, this is the first time that these findings have been related with HAM/TSP outcome, although polymorphism SNP rs12979860 has already been implicated in a sustained virological response to HCV infection in patients treated with pegylated interferon alpha and ribavirin [19], a finding that has not been demonstrated for other viral infections, such as HBV and HIV infections [20]. Moreover, the profile of polymorphism SNP rs12979860 could induce the production of IFN-lambda 3, and an immune active HTLV-1 infection with neuronal damage in the spinal cord, providing additional evidence for immune damage in the HAM/TSP pathogenesis [11], [16]. Our own previous study showed that patients with HAM/TSP had higher levels of IFN-gamma and MIP1-alpha production compared to asymptomatic patients [21]. However, and despite all the evidence mentioned above, we cannot exclude the possibility that those polymorphisms are but a marker of the disease.The majority of the studies, so far, emphasized the polymorphism SNP rs12979860. However, Soriano's group showed higher proviral loads among HAM/TSP patients, although no association between HAM/TSP and IL28B has been found [10]. This fact could have been due to the small sample size (n = 12 patients) or to a different ethnic background of patients in that study. More recently, a Brazilian study also failed to find a positive association between the IL28B rs12979860 polymorphisms and an increased risk of developing HAM/TSP in 24 patients [18]. Our study population was not in HWE equilibrium for both polymorphisms, what may even indicate a higher risk for patients carrying the GG genotype. Furthermore, there seems to be biological plausibility for the association we found, based on previous findings [10], [18].Thus, for the first time, this polymorphism was associated with clinical outcome, as described in our study. In fact, PVL is important in HAM/TSP patients since they may have up to 5–6 times more HTLV-1 proviral DNA in PBMC when compared to asymptomatic carriers, what may be related to many of the immunologic responses discussed above [22]. Other genetic background characteristics, such as some HLA haplotypes, have been described as involved in HAM/TSP pathogenesis [23] or pro-inflammatory factors [17]. In this regard, IL28B polymorphisms are influenced by genetic ancestry. Given the historical context of the Brazilian colonization, the population displays unique genetic characteristics, presenting phenotypes from African, European and Amerindian populations [24]. For example, the genotype GG (SNP rs8099917) genotype is more frequent in Asiatic, African and European Americans, while CC (SNP rs12979860) genotype is more frequent in European and Amerindian populations [25]. In recent study in South of Brazil, showed that in HCV-infected subjects and non-HCV-infected individuals, the higher allele frequency of rs12979860 C and rs8099917 T [26]. The distribution of those genotypes is similar to the genotype distribution found in our study.Similarly, among HCV chronic patients, those who carried the G risk allele at rs8099917 had lower PBMC mRNA expression of IL28B [27]. It is likely that regulation will differ in the infected tissue and even between cell types within the liver and maybe in the spinal cord, as reported recently for some interferon stimulated genes [28]. IL28B attenuates IL-13; it is also possible that the cytokine produced in persons with the protective genotype diminishes IL-13 to a lesser extent than the molecule with the risk genotype, similar to the protective effect of the least inhibitory interactions between KIR and HLA-C [29]. Thus, IL28B and other type 3 interferons like IL28A or IL-29 trigger an antiviral cascade via JAK-STAT that is similar and probably synergistic with type 1 interferons (such as interferon alfa), although using distinct receptors, contributing to HAM/TSP immune pathogenesis.Finally, a tentative explanation: persons with SNP rs8099917 genotype GG may present a distinct immune response against HTLV-1 infection. However, since this is the first description of this finding in the literature, we should first replicate this study with more HTLV-1-infected persons to strengthen the evidence already provided by our results. It is likely that IL28B may have some importance for protection against disease progression [11], but further cohort studies should be done in order to test this hypothesis."
