"Patient's characteristics
In this study, all 400 HCV sero-reactive patients were genotyped at SNP rs12979860, rs 8099917 for IL28B analysis. Out of the total, 293 (73.25%) were HCV RNA positive based on RNA quantitation (Figure 1). The demographic data, biochemical parameters, viral loads and viral genotypes of the samples assessed are summarized in Table 1. Among the study cohort males were 272 (68%) whilst females were 128 (32%). The mean age for females was 33.79±20.56 and for males were 31.05±18.91 years respectively. There was no statistical difference in the mean age between control and patient groups. ALT levels were significantly elevated in the patient groups compared to control population.

HCV genotyping
Hepatitis C viral genotyping analysis revealed that genotype 3 (n = 193, 65.87%) was the predominant circulating strain followed by genotype 1 (n = 94, 32.08%) in this geographical region. Within genotype 3, HCV subtype 3a was the most commonly encountered strain accounting for 73.12% of the cases followed by genotype 3b in 26.88% individuals. Conversely, genotype 1b (n = 49, 52.12%) was the commonest within genotype 1 infected patients followed by genotype 1a (n = 43, 45.74%) and genotype 1c was found in only 2 (2.14%) individuals. A small percentage (n = 6, 2.05%) of new emerging genotype 6 was observed particularly in north-eastern isolates with history of intravenous drug uses (IVDUs). IL28B genotyping analysis
Host genotyping was done on 400 patients to determine the prevalence of the host genotypic markers at locus rs12979860 and rs8099917. The frequency of CC genotype associated with HCV clearance at rs1297960 was 70.75% (283 out of 400 individuals) compared to CT at 24% (96 out of 400). The distribution of genotype TT at locus rs12979860 reported to have poor HCV clearance rate was 5.25% (21 out of 400). Analysis of host genotype at rs8099917 reveals that the favourable genotype TT was present in 77.50% individuals (310 out of 400), TG was present in 15% individuals (60 out of 400), whereas GG, the unfavourable genotype was present in 7.50% individuals (30 out of 400).
Amongst the healthy subjects (n = 100), frequency of CC host genotype at locus rs12979860 was 73%, CT genotype was 23% whilst TT was 4%. Analysis of the allele frequencies shows that C allele frequency 0.85 whilst T allele frequency was at 0.15. The distribution of allelic frequencies was in accordance to the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (χ2  = 1.49, p<0.05). Similar analysis was performed for locus rs8099917 amongst healthy individuals showed that favourable allele TT was found in 70% individuals followed by TG allele at 30%; none of the individual reported GG at rs8099917. The allele frequencies at rs8099917 was also found to be in Hardy –Weinberg equilibrium with T allele frequency at 0.85 and G allele frequency at 0.15 (χ2 = 3.11, p<0.05).
Analysis of the host genotypes present within HCV genotype 3 infected individuals shows that CC allele at locus rs12979860 was predominant in both genotype 3a and genotype 3b at 72.09% and 84.21% respectively (Figure 2a). Similarly, at locus rs8099917 favourable TT allele was predominant in both genotype 3a and 3b at 76.74% and 63.15% respectively (Figure 2b).

Among the 293 HCV RNA positive individuals, 83 genotype 3 infected individuals were treated with interferon and were evaluated for virological response (Figure 1). SVR was achieved in 46 out of 83 individuals (55.42%) while RVR was achieved in 26 individuals (31.3%) (Figure 1). In the interferon treated patient group, RVR was found to be an important predictor for SVR and can be considered as an important factor for determining the IFN response. Of the patients achieving RVR, 77% of them carried the favourable CC allele at rs12979860; whilst 73.2% of the individuals carried the favourable TT allele at rs8099917 locus (Figure 3a and 3b). In individuals with relapsed HCV infection, 66% of them carried CT allele at rs12979860 and 72.4% individuals carried TG allele at rs8099917 locus. Unfavourable TT and GG allele were present in 34% and 27.6% individuals at rs12979860 and rs8099917 loci respectively (Figure 3c).

We studied the influence of the IL28B genotype on the SVR in patients with either high or low baseline viral load for genotype 3 as rs12979860 is the single most statistically important predictor. Our results show that host genotype CC at rs12979860 was statistically correlated with high viral load but not with low viral load for genotype 3 infected individuals (Table 2).

Analysis of treatment naive HCV infected individuals showed that rs12979860 CC allele was predominant with 146 out of 210 (69.50%) individuals carrying this favourable allele, followed by rs12979860 CT allele being present in 55 individuals (26.3%); unfavourable TT allele was present in 4.2% individuals. Similarly, favourable rs8099917 TT allele was present in 78.09% (164 out of 210) of treatment naive HCV infected patients, whereas rs8099917 TG allele was present in 14.28% individuals (30 out of 210) and unfavourable rs8099917 GG allele was present in only 7.63% individuals (15 out of 210). Thus in our study it was seen that favourable alleles were dominant within our study population. IL28B polymorphisms in advanced liver disease (AdLD)
Clinical observation showed that 33 out of the 293 HCV RNA positive individuals (11.2%) were diagnosed to be in different stages of advanced liver diseases (AdLD). Analysis of the frequencies of IL28B genotypes showed that within this group, heterozygous CT genotype (63.63%) was the predominant allele at rs12979860 and TG genotype (69.69%) at rs8099917 (Figure 4). Favourable genotype CC and TT at rs12979860, rs8099917 were found in only two and one individual respectively.

HCV usually induces a robust immune response but it has developed mechanisms to escape immune defense and establish persistent infection [8]. Recent reports indicate that 12.5 million people are infected in India and the number is steadily increasing day by day [5]. As per current guidelines for clinical practice, HCV genotype and HCV RNA levels at baseline are considered to be an important marker before starting the antiviral interferon therapy but studies show that the treatment progression is often marred by side effects which ultimately force the patients to discontinue the therapy [10].Ge et al. (2009), found that rs12979860 single nucleotide polymorphism, located 3 kb upstream of the IL28B gene was the strongest host predictor for treatment response in HCV patients infected with genotype 1 strain [11]. Tanaka et al. (2009), found rs8099917, another IL28B polymorphism which is located around 8 kb upstream of the IL28B gene, to be the strongest genetic determinant of SVR in HCV genotype 1 infected patients [12]. Initially, most of the studies have concentrated on the HCV genotype 1 as this genotype is more common in western countries [19]. However, the impact of these polymorphisms within genotype 3 HCV infected individuals remains understudied. Reports have also indicated that ethnic differences in the IL28B gene polymorphisms may explain at least in part, the different outcome rates of HCV infection in different population groups [20], [21], [22].Differences in treatment outcome with respect to antiviral treatment have led the researchers in the present study to ascertain the frequency of IL28B host genotype within different population groups in eastern and north eastern India. The Indian population is ethnically heterogeneous; therefore, genetic variability is expected. Not much data are available about the frequency of host genotype rs12979860 or rs8099917 in India, a study conducted by Sivaprasad et al (2012), amongst south Indian population demonstrated that the proportion of CC allele was higher than the proportion of CT, TT at rs12979860 alleles in the south Indian population, but the study concentrated only on the proportion of the host alleles amongst the healthy individuals [23]. Our study on the other hand analyzed both the healthy individuals as well as HCV infected individuals, to get a clear picture of the genetic disposition of the host genotypes. In this study, analysis of healthy individuals showed that our data is in concordance with the data obtained by Sivaprasad et al (2012) but the percentage of favourable CC allele at rs12979860 locus was higher at 73% in contrast to 59.09% [23]. Additionally, our study analyzed the host genetic disposition at both rs12979860 and rs8099917 amongst healthy individuals which was not done elsewhere.The association between IL28B polymorphism and the progression of liver fibrosis is still controversial, as the possible underlying mechanisms are still unknown to us [24], [25]. Within our study population, viral genotype 3 was found to be most widely circulated strain; HCV genotype 3 is reportedly associated with steatosis and rapid progression to HCC. Due to its association with steatosis, we have studied the proportion of IL28B genotypes in HCV infected patients in different stages of advanced liver diseases (AdLD). We observed that the percentage of unfavourable CT and TG allele were more in these patients as compared to favourable CC and TT allele at rs12979860 and rs8099917 respectively (Figure 3).Several reports indicate strong association between IL28B polymorphism and SVR; the mechanisms are still not properly understood. Response guided therapy for CHC patients based on IL28B genotypes, viral genotypes and treatment response is the current treatment strategy. RVR was found to be the useful predictor for SVR in treatment of CHC with peg-IFN plus ribavirin. With this aspect in mind, we examined the host genotypes associated with different IFN responses. In patients with RVR, CC genotypes at rs12979860 were present in 77% of the patients whereas the unfavourable CT was present in only 23% of the individuals. Interestingly, none of the patients achieving RVR reported unfavourable TT allele at rs12979860. Similarly, at locus rs8099917, response rates were 73.2% TT, 19.2% TG, followed by 7.6% GG allele (Figure 3a). Similar results were obtained in patients with SVR which shows that in 83% of the patients achieving SVR had the favourable CC allele at rs12979860. Interestingly, in patients with relapsed infection it was seen that 66% of the patients had unfavourable CT allele at their rs12979860 locus followed by 34% TT allele. Also at rs8099917, TG genotype was present in 72.4% individuals followed by GG host genotype in 27.6% individuals (Figure 3b). Therefore, it could be assumed that favourable genotypes at both rs12979860 and rs8099917 could be important markers for the prediction of the favourable results in patients undergoing IFN therapy in genotype 3 infected patients (Figure 3a and 3b). Within treatment naive HCV infected individuals, our results showed that the percentage of favourable allele rs12979860 CC and rs8099917 TT was higher; therefore it could be assumed that within our study population the propensity to towards favourable alleles is higher and it could be a valuable input for physicians in predicting the treatment response.The limitation of the study was that the number of samples size with patients undergoing IFN treatment was small. A large cohort of patients undergoing IFN therapy is needed to explain in detail how the SNP rs12979860 and rs8099917 could influence the treatment response in HCV genotype 3 infected population.Our results are the first report from this part of the country providing information about the impact of IL28B genotypes in different HCV infected population groups from eastern and north-eastern India. Our results for the first time indicate that for HCV genotype 3 infected patients, CC genotype at rs12979860 is an important predictor for patients to achieve RVR. Additionally our results also emphasized the point that rs12979860 CC host genotype was significantly associated with SVR in genotype 3 infected individuals with high viral load. To best of our knowledge, our data on SNP rs8099917 is the first Indian data within HCV infected population to be reported from this region.In conclusion, it could be said that in the current scenario, where the cost of IFN treatment for HCV is very high to the people of our country where the healthcare system is already overburdened with lack of resources. Therefore, it is the need of the hour to shift our focus to how the treatment mechanisms can be tailor-made to suit every individual's genetic makeup."
