"Baseline characteristics
Two hundred and sixty patients infected with HCV were enrolled in this study. Baseline characteristics of the patients are shown in Table 1. All patients were Japanese had a median age of 55.6 years, and 137 (52.7%) were male. Mean body mass index (BMI) was 23.1 kg/m2, with 45 and 9 of these patients classified as overweight (25.0–29.9 kg/m2) and obese (≥30 kg/m2), respectively. Only one patient with HCV genotype 3 was included. US revealed fatty change of the liver and hepatic cirrhosis in 127 (47.6%) and 37 (14.2%), respectively.

Genotype frequencies of SNPs in PNPLA3, IL28B and TLR4 genes
Genotype frequencies of PNPLA3 rs738409 and IL28B rs8099917 genotypes among the patients are shown in Figure 1. Among the 260 total patients, 182 (70.0%) and 81 (31.1%) had PNPLA3 rs738409 G-allele and IL28B rs 8099917 G-allele, respectively. All patients were AA genotype of TLR4 rs4986790 and CC genotype of TLR4 rs4986791. These results indicated that the Japanese patients in the present study had uniform distribution of these two TLR4 SNPs.

Clinical characteristics of the patients in the present study were compared between the PNPLA3 rs738409 G-allele and non-G allele groups (Table 2). There were no significant differences between the two groups, although HCV RNA levels tended to be higher in the PNPLA3 rs738409 G-allele group than in the non-G allele group. US showed similar fatty change of the liver in the two groups as well as similar distribution of patients with advanced fibrosis in the present study (Table 2).

The patient characteristics of those with IL28B rs809917 genotype are shown in Table 3. γ-GTP levels were higher in the IL28B rs809917 minor allele (TG or GG) group than in the major allele (TT) group. However, the present study did not show any association between IL28B rs809917 genotype and fatty change of the liver or the existence of hepatic cirrhosis based on US findings.

Comparison of patient characteristics with and without fatty change of the liver
The patient characteristics with and without fatty change of the liver based on US finding results are shown in Table 4. By univariate analysis, younger age (P<0.01), higher BMI (P<0.01), and a lower proportion of cirrhotic patients (P<0.01) were observed in patients with fatty change of the liver. Factors significantly associated with fatty change of the liver by univariate analysis were analyzed by multivariate logistic regression analysis again (Table 5). Fatty change of the liver was attained independent of the abscence of hepatic cirrhosis on US findings and age ≤58 years.

The patient characteristics with and without hepatic cirrhosis according to US findings are shown in Table 6. By univariate analysis, higher BMI (P = 0.016), higher γ-GTP (P<0.01), lower platelet count (P = 0.046), lower total cholesterol (P = 0.013), higher AFP (P<0.01), higher aspartate aminotransferase/platelet ratio index (APRI) (P<0.01) and a lower proportion of fatty change of the liver (P<0.01) were observed in patients with hepatic cirrhosis. By multivariate logistic regression analysis, hepatic cirrhosis was attained independent of higher APRI, no fatty change of the liver on US findings, higher BMI and higher AFP levels (Table 7).

Despite our study population being relatively small, PNPLA3 rs738409 and IL28B rs8099917 genotypes seemed to have no association with fatty liver or the presence of hepatic cirrhosis although TLR4 rs4986790 and rs4986791 genotypes were uniform in the patients of the present study.Hepatic steatosis is frequently observed in chronic hepatitis C patients (42–73%) [28] and is influenced by several factors, such as alcohol comsumption, age, BMI, obesity, hyperglycemia, diabetes mellitus and HCV genotype 3 [29]. Hepatic steatosis in chronic hepatitis C patients is associated with more severe liver damage, more advanced liver fibrosis [30], and poor response to peginterferon-alpha plus ribavirin treatment [31], [32]. Despite the majority of our study patients being HCV genotype 1 or 2, fatty change of the liver was associated with younger age and absence of hepatic cirrhosis (Table 5).It had been reported that PNPLA3 rs738409 was associated with hepatic steatosis and steatohepatitis in NAFLD [11], [33]. The GG genotype was shown to be related to a greater risk of inflammation and cirrhosis. Japanese studies [34]–[36] also showed similar results. Kitamoto et al. [36] demonstrated that Matteoni type4 NAFLD is both a genetically and clinically different subset from the other spectrums of the disease and that the PNPLA3 gene is strongly associated with the progression of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in Japanese, whose BMI is lower than that of the United States and European countries [37]–[39].In chronic hepatitis C patients, several studies suggested that PNPLA3 genotype influences hepatic steatosis and liver fibrosis [40], [41]. However, our results showed no association between PNPLA3 rs738409 and hepatic steatosis or liver fibrosis. It is possible that the different evaluation methods, such as US and liver biopsy, and different ethnicity or different distribution of PNPLA3 rs738409 genotypes might have different association with hepatic steatosis and liver fibrosis in Japanese patients with chronic hepatitis C. We also could not completely rule out the possibility that there exist different mechanisms of hepatic steatosis and liver fibrosis between NAFLD and hepatitis C [7]–[9]. Further studies will be needed regarding this point.In contrast to previous studies [26], [27], IL28B rs8099917 also did not influence hepatic steatosis and liver fibrosis in the present Japanese study. US is a widely accessible and easy-to-use diagnostic imaging modality suitable for the qualitative assessment of diffuse liver disease in clinical daily practice [42]. Clinically, steatosis or fatty liver appears as a brighter image relative to the adjacent kidney or spleen and shows greater attenuation in severe cases, often obscuring the hepatic and portal vein walls [42]. The difference in results between the previous studies and ours might be ascribed to the methods used for the diagnosis of fatty liver and hepatic cirrhosis [43]. Although liver biopsy remains a standard method of diagnosis of diffuse liver disease, it is certainly an invasive technique compared to US. In the near future, transient elastography will be useful for the evaluation of hepatic fibrosis in chronic hepatitis C patients with hepatic steatosis. However, at present, it should be interpreted cautiously in NAFLD patients, where host- or disease-related factors may modify its accuracy [44].Hepatocellular carcinoma is a documented complication in an unknown percentage of cases of NASH cirrhosis [45]. Yoshioka et al. [46] reported that the noncancerous liver showed burn-out NASH; steatosis, necroinflammation, ballooning degeneration, and Mallory bodies had all disappeared at the autopsy of an HCC case with NASH cirrhosis. Of interest, our present study also demonstrated the association between fatty change of the liver and no advanced fibrosis in Japanese patients with chronic hepatitis C.In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that there was no association between PNPLA3 rs738409 genotype/IL28B rs8099917 genotype and hepatic steatosis or liver fibrosis in Japanese patients infected with HCV, although the results of our study were based on US findings. We found that fatty change of the liver was associated with patient age and liver fibrosis. Additionally, hepatic cirrhosis was also associated with higher APRI, no fatty change of the liver, higher BMI and higher AFP levels. Greater accuracy of non-invasive methods for the diagnosis of patients might be desired to enable further analysis. Together, our results suggest that the mechanism that exists in hepatic steatosis of HCV infection might differ from that of NAFLD, and additional study will be needed to further explore these mechanisms."
