"sCD26 and Treatment Outcome in Genotype 1–3 Patients from Two Independent Studies Eighty-four percent of the genotype 1–3 patients included in the DITTO study were available for sCD26 analysis. Neither the included genotype 1 (Table 1) nor genotype 2/3 (Table 2) patients differed significantly regarding the evaluated parameters compared with the full DITTO study cohort. The included genotype 1 patients from the DITTO study who responded to therapy displayed significantly lower baseline sCD26 concentration (P = 0.002; Figure 1A) and significantly lower DPPIV activity (P = 0.02; Figure 1B) compared with patients failing treatment. There was an overall weak, albeit highly significant, correlation between the sCD26 concentration and the DPPIV activity (rs = 0.35, P = 0.0001, n = 150). 10.1371/journal.pone.0056991.g001 Figure 1 CD26 in genotype 1 patients from the DITTO-HCV and TTG studies grouped depending on treatment outcome.

Box plots display the 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 90th percentiles. The dashed line indicates the 600 ng/mL sCD26 cut-off concentration. Statistics analysis using two-tailed Mann-Whitney U-test. A ROC analysis was performed to evaluate the baseline sCD26 concentration with regards to previously established predictors of SVR. The baseline levels of HCV RNA (0.666) and IP-10 (0.662) showed the highest AUC values followed by the baseline sCD26 concentration (0.647) and the DPPIV activity (0.645; Figure 2A). The TG-ROC analysis determined the baseline sCD26 concentration cut-off value for the genotype 1 patients in the DITTO study to 600 ng/mL sCD26 by choosing the sCD26 concentration where the sensitivity intersected with the specificity (Figure 2B) [36]. The patients with sCD26 concentrations <600 ng/mL had a significantly greater decline in HCV RNA day 0 to 1 (P = 0.005) as well as a significant higher likelihood of achieving SVR (P = 0.01) (Table 3). Patients with lower sCD26 concentrations also showed significantly lower concentrations of IP-10 (P = 0.04), as well as lower levels of HCV RNA (P = 0.02) and ALT (P = 0.03) along with a lower BMI and a higher proportion of female gender (Table 4). However, the sCD26 did not significantly correlate with either ALT (rs = 0.155, P = 0.06, n = 153) or HCV RNA (rs = 0.120, P = 0.14, n = 153), but correlated weakly albeit significantly with IP-10 (rs = 0.261, P = 0.001, n = 150). 10.1371/journal.pone.0056991.g002 Figure 2 ROC analysis and assessment of the sCD26 concentration cut-off value.

Statistics using aχ2 test and bMann-Whitney U test. In order to further evaluate the predictive value of the baseline sCD26 concentration and the 600 ng/mL sCD26 concentration cut-off for treatment outcome, sCD26 concentrations in 36 patients chronically infected with HCV genotype 1 from an independent study (the TTG1 trial) were assessed. In line with the results from the DITTO-HCV study, patients achieving SVR (n = 25) showed significantly lower sCD26 concentrations compared with patients who did not achieve SVR (n = 11) (P = 0.02; Figure 1C), however without any significant differences in DPPIV activity (P = 0.4). The 600 ng/mL sCD26 cut-off value yielded a 93% (12 of 13) SVR rate for the patients below 600 ng/mL compared with a 57% (13 of 23) SVR rate for of the patients above 600 ng/mL sCD26 (P = 0.03). Interestingly, genotype 2 or 3 infected patients showed significantly lower baseline sCD26 concentrations compared with the genotype 1 patients (P = 0.03; Figure 3) with a trend towards higher sCD26 concentrations for the three genotype 2/3 patients not achieving SVR (median 498 vs. 618 ng/mL sCD26 for SVR and non-SVR patients respectively; n = 58, P = 0.07). In addition, grouping the patients above or below the 600 ng/mL sCD26 cut-off resulted in 100% (37 of 37) SVR for the patients with <600 ng/mL sCD26 and 86% (18 of 21) SVR for the >600 ng/mL sCD26 patients (P = 0.02). 10.1371/journal.pone.0056991.g003 Figure 3 Baseline sCD26 concentrations in genotype 1, 2 and 3 patients in the DITTO-HCV study.

Statistics analysis for genotype 1 vs. genotype 2 and 3 using two-tailed Mann-Whitney U-test. sCD26 Independently Predicts SVR In order to determine if sCD26 independently impacts treatment outcome for HCV genotype 1 infected patients, a stepwise binary logistic regression was performed using the baseline factors in Table 4. Lower sCD26 concentrations independently predicted SVR among HCV genotype 1 infected patients, with a 0.2% odds reduction for achieving SVR for each incremental ng/mL sCD26 concentration increase (P < 0.05; Table 5). The other independent baseline predictive markers of SVR were lower HCV RNA concentration (P = 0.001), lower BMI (P = 0.01), male gender (P = 0.004), and favorable IL28Brs12980275 genetic variant (P = 0.03). Furthermore, using the 600 ng/mL sCD26 cut-off concentration resulted in 65% sensitivity, 61% specificity, a 65% positive predictive value (PPV), and a 61% negative predictive value (NPV) (Table 6). 10.1371/journal.pone.0056991.t005 Table 5 Odds ratio (OR) and stepwise binary logistic regression analysis identifying pretreatment factors independently predictive of SVR in DITTO-HCV genotype 1 patients.

We have previously reported that IP-10 levels are weakly but significantly associated with IL28B genetic variants [13]. However, no such association was observed between the baseline sCD26 concentration and IL28B rs12970860 (P = 0.4, Kruskal-Wallis test), rs12980275 (P = 0.6), or rs809917 (P = 0.6) SNPs or IL28B genotype distribution (Table 4) for the DITTO-HCV genotype 1 patients. In agreement with the observation that there was no association between the baseline sCD26 concentration and IL28B genotypes, having below the 600 ng/mL sCD26 cut-off value significantly improved the treatment response rate in the genotype 1 DITTO-HCV patients with one or two IL28B risk alleles (CT/TTrs12970860 P = 0.04, AG/GGrs12980275 P = 0.01, and rs809917 P = 0.007; Table 7). Similarly, lower sCD26 concentrations significantly increased the likelihood of achieving SVR in patients with baseline plasma IP-10 concentrations between 150 pg/mL and 600 pg/mL (P = 0.002, Table 7). 10.1371/journal.pone.0056991.t007 Table 7 The impact of IL28B polymorphisms, baseline plasma IP-10 and sCD26 concentrations on the likelihood of achieving SVR for the DITTO-HCV genotype 1 patients grouped using the IL28B genotypes, or the IP-10 or the sCD26 cut-offs.

Short-term HCV-specific CD8+ T cells To evaluate the association between sCD26 concentrations and the HCV-specific CD8+ T cell response, PBMCs collected prior to therapy from 28 HLA-A2 or HLA-A3 positive patients were analyzed for their ability to recognize and produce IFN-γ after stimulation with HLA-A2 or HLA-A3 restricted genotype 1a peptides. When grouping the patients above or below 600 ng/mL sCD26, it was observed that patients below the cut-off had significantly more HCV-tetramer+ CD8+ T cells (P = 0.02, Figure 4A) with a similar trend towards more IFN-γ producing CD8+ T cells following stimulation with HCV specific peptides (P = 0.09, Figure 4B) compared with patients with sCD26 above the cut-off concentration prior to therapy. In line with this observation, a negative correlation between the sCD26 level and the percent HCV-tetramer+ CD8+ T cells was observed (rs = −0.41, P = 0.03, n = 28). Furthermore, a strong correlation was observed between the percentage of HCV-tetramer+ CD8+ T cells and the percentage of IFN-γ producing CD8+ T cells among patients below the sCD26 cut-off (rs = 0.87, P = 0.0001, n = 18). However, no such correlation was observed among patients above the sCD26 cut-off (rs = −0.11, P = 0.8, n = 10). 10.1371/journal.pone.0056991.g004 Figure 4 IFN-γ+ CD8+ T cells after stimulation with genotype 1a HCV specific HLA-A2 or HLA-A3 restricted peptides after in vitro expansion. (A) Frequency of HCV-tetramer+ CD8+ T cells after 10 days in vitro expansion for patients (n = 28) grouped above or below the median for sCD26. (B) Frequency of IFN-γ+ CD8+ T cells after 10 days in vitro expansion for patients (n = 28) grouped above or below the median for sCD26. Statistic using two-tailed Mann-Whitney U-test. Additionally, no associations were noted between the frequencies of HCV-tetramer+ CD8+ T cells (P = 0.4) or IFN-γ+ CD8+ T cells (P = 0.7) when grouping the patients above or below the baseline median IP-10 concentration, or between the frequencies of HCV-tetramer+ CD8+ T cells (P = 0.2) or IFN-γ+ CD8+ T cells (P = 0.5) and the IL28Brs12979860 CC versus non-CC genotypes. The main finding in the present study was that genotype 1 infected patients achieving SVR after treatment with pegIFN-α/ribavirin demonstrated lower baseline plasma sCD26 concentrations in two independent studies. Lower sCD26 concentrations were not associated with IL28B genetic variation, and consequently having lower baseline sCD26 concentrations significantly improved the likelihood of achieving SVR among all IL28B SNP risk alleles in HCV genotype 1 infected patients.Additionally in these two studies, the sCD26 concentration was a more reliable predictor of treatment outcome than DPPIV activity. The surprisingly weak, but highly significant, correlation between sCD26 concentration and DPPIV activity could in part be explained by the existence of both cleaved membrane bound and soluble CD26 in plasma with inherently different DPPIV activity [37], or by differential impact of storage time or possible freeze-thawing. It would have been of interest to measure the impact of IP-10 truncation on SVR in the current studies, however the levels of truncated IP-10 could not be quantified subsequent to the lack of DPPIV inhibitors at the time of sampling, which is necessary to prevent artifactual extravascular IP-10 truncation [20]. Also, having female gender is usually a positive predictor of SVR following HCV therapy, however, the complete DITTO study has previously shown a higher SVR rate among male patients [14] and accordingly the DITTO cohort in the present study also demonstrated male gender to be associated with favorable outcome (Table 5). CD26 has previously been suggested to be a marker for liver disease [38] and higher sCD26 could thus be an indicator of liver injury. In the present study however, the distribution of fibrosis stages were not significantly different when grouping the patients above or below the sCD26 cut-off (Table 4). Also the sCD26 concentration did not significantly correlate with ALT, and the genotype 2/3 cohort showed higher ALT despite having lower sCD26 concentrations as compared with genotype 1 infected patients (Table 1 and 2).Interestingly, it was observed that the sCD26 concentrations were significantly lower among HCV genotype 2 and 3 infected patients than among those infected with genotype 1. A similar non-significant trend towards lower baseline IP-10 levels for HCV genotype 2/3 in comparison with genotype 1/4 infected patients has previously been reported from the same study cohort [14], [15]. The mechanisms underlying these observations merit further investigation.Previous studies have correlated exhausted HCV-specific CD8+ T cells with treatment failure [26]. To evaluate whether the sCD26 concentration could function as a marker of functional HCV-specific T cells, short-term HCV-specific CD8+ T cells from HLA-A2+ or HLA-A3+ patients were generated along with assessment of the ability of these cells to produce IFN-γ after stimulation with HCV specific peptides. Interestingly, these data suggested, albeit obtained from a small number of patients (n = 28), that a low baseline sCD26 concentration may be associated with the presence of functional HCV-specific T cells, whereas higher sCD26 concentration could indicate a T cell exhausted phenotype that has previously been described in patients with chronic HCV infection who fail therapy [39]. The limited number of patients available for T cell analyzes only differed significantly compared with the complete cohort with regards to baseline IP-10 for the four genotype 2/3 infected patients (Table 1 and 2), thus suggesting the evaluated patients may be representative of the larger cohort. Treatment response mechanisms, however, are complex, and the presence of functional HCV-specific T cells does not consistently entail improved likelihood of achieving SVR [28].In conclusion and in agreement with the report by Casrouge et al. (2011) [20], the present study suggests that lower baseline sCD26 concentrations are associated with improved response to combination therapy for HCV genotype 1 infection. Furthermore, we could show that having sCD26 concentrations below the 600 ng/mL sCD26 cut-off value augmented the predictive value of both baseline IP-10 concentration and IL28B genetic variants. The very rapid clearance of HCV viremia observed following the recent introduction of new DAAs for HCV, including nucleotide polymerase inhibitors, likely will hamper the utility of on-treatment levels of HCV RNA in tailoring therapy. Thus it is reasonable to assume that baseline markers of response, such as sCD26 concentration, may increase in importance in order to personalize HCV treatment duration or choice of therapy as well as reduce cost. However, further prospective studies to validate the sCD26 concentration and its association with HCV-specific T cells are warranted."
