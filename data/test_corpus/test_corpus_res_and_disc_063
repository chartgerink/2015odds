"Characteristics of CHB patients receiving PEG-IFN therapy Baseline characteristics of the 74 CHB patients were summarized in Table 1. Patients were predominantly males (77%) and genotype B (64.9%). BCP mutations and precore mutations were observed in 31.1% and 47.3% of patients, respectively. The prevalence of the major IL28B genotypes rs8105790 TT, rs12979860 CC, rs8099917 TT, and rs10853728 CC were 94.6%, 93.2%, 94.6% and 71.6%, respectively. In the 36 HBeAg-positive patients, 30 (83.3%) received 24-weeks and 5 6 (16.7%) received 48-week PEG-IFN therapy. All 38 HBeAg-negative patients received 48-week PEG-IFN therapy. Seventy-three (98.6%) patients completed the full course of PEG-IFN therapy, while 1 (1.4%) patient discontinued PEG-IFN treatment due to intolerance and were switched to oral antiviral therapies. The patient who failed to complete PEG-IFN therapy was classified as non-responder to PEG-IFN for analysis in this study. 10.1371/journal.pone.0076798.t001Table 1 Baseline characteristics of the CHB patients with or without sustained virological response (SVR).

Among the 36 HBeAg-positive patients, 12 (33.3%) achieved HBeAg seroconversion, including 10 of the 30 patients (33.3%) receiving 24-week course of treatment and 2 of the 6 patients (33.3%) receiving 48-week course of treatment; whereas only 7 (19.4%) finally achieved SVR, including 6 of the 30 patients (20%) receiving 24-week course of treatment and 1 of the 6 patients (16.7%) receiving 48-week course of treatment. In HBeAg-negative patients, 12 (31.6%) achieved SVR and 2 cases (5.3%) achieved HBsAg clearance at 48 weeks after the end of PEG-IFN treatment. During the extended follow-up period between 24 to 48 weeks post treatment, one HBeAg-positive patient developed HBeAg seroconversion and one HBeAg-negative patient had viral relapse. Dynamic changes of virological and immunological factors Dynamic changes of serum HBV DNA, HBsAg, cytokine and chemokine levels from baseline to week 12 of PEG-IFN treatment were shown in Table 2. Viral load, HBsAg, IP-10 and IFN-γ levels significant declined after 12 weeks of PEG-IFN treatment. No significant changes were observed in CXCL9 and TGF-β levels from baseline to week 12 in overall patients. 10.1371/journal.pone.0076798.t002Table 2 Dynamic changes of HBV viral load, HBsAg and cytokine/chemokine levels in CHB patients at baseline and week 12 of PEG-IFN therapy.

In patients with SVR, CXCL9 levels significantly decreased from baseline to week 12, and further decreased at EOT (mean value 228.4, 153.1 and 52.7 pg/mL at baseline, week 12 and EOT, respectively; baseline vs week12, p=0.039; week 12 vs EOT, p=0.208; Figure 1). In patients without SVR, CXCL9 levels remained high at week 12 but decreased later from week 12 to EOT (mean value 126.2, 136.2 and 103.8 pg/mL at baseline, week 12 and EOT, respectively; baseline vs week12, p=0.754; week 12 vs EOT, p=0.005, Figure 1). 10.1371/journal.pone.0076798.g001Figure 1 Kinetics of serum CXCL9 levels during PEG-IFN treatment in CHB patients with or without SVR. In patients with SVR, CXCL9 levels significantly decreased from baseline to week 12, whereas in patients without SVR, CXCL9 levels remained high at week 12 but decreased later from week 12 to EOT. Data were presented as mean ± standard errors of the means (SEM). EOT: end of treatment. The early CXCL9 levels decline positively correlated with the declines of HBV DNA (r=0.319, p=0.014) and HBsAg levels (r=0.315, p=0.023) at week 12 of PEG-IFN therapy. In contrast, no significant correlations were noted between IP-10 levels decline and declines of viral load or HBsAg levels. Correlation between serum ALT and chemokine levels Serum ALT, CXCL9 and IP-10 levels were measured at each time point during PEG-IFN treatment for correlation analysis (overall n=232). As shown in Figure 2, ALT had positive correlation with both serum CXCL9 (r=0.335, p<0.001) and IP-10 levels (r=0.423, p<0.001) by Spearman’s test. Serum CXCL9 and IP-10 levels also had a positive correlation with each other (r=0.353, p<0.001). 10.1371/journal.pone.0076798.g002Figure 2 Correlations between serum ALT and chemokine levels. (A) A positive correlation between CXCL9 and ALT; (B). A positive correlation between IP-10 and ALT. Concentrations of serum ALT, CXCL9 and IP-10 levels were collected at each time point during PEG-IFN treatment (overall n=232). Baseline predictors of SVR Compared with patients not achieving SVR, patients with SVR had significantly lower HBV DNA, HBsAg levels and higher CXCL9 levels (Table 1). In contrast, HBV genotypes, precore or BCP mutations, serum IP-10, IFN-γ, TGF-β levels and the four IL28B SNPs were not associated with SVR. In univariate analysis, age, HBV viral loads, HBsAg and CXCL9 levels were factors associated with SVR (Table 3). In multivariate analysis, HBV DNA <2.5 x 107 IU/mL and CXCL9 >80 pg/mL were pre-treatment predictors of SVR (Table 3). 10.1371/journal.pone.0076798.t003Table 3 Univariate and multivariate analyses of factors associated with sustained virological response.

None of the patients who did not have HBsAg decline >10% at week 12 achieved SVR. In HBeAg-positive patients, age, precore mutation, baseline HBV viral loads and CXCL9 levels correlated with SVR in univariate analysis, while HBV DNA <2.5 x 107 IU/mL was the only predictor of SVR in multivariate analysis (Table S1). In HBeAg-negative patients, HBV DNA, HBsAg and CXCL9 levels correlated with SVR in univariate analysis, while CXCL9 >80 pg/mL was the only pre-treatment predictors of SVR in multivariate analysis (Table S2). On-treatment predictors of SVR In univariate analysis, HBV viral load and HBsAg levels, HBV DNA decline >2 Log10 and HBsAg decline >10% at week 12 were on-treatment factors associated with SVR (Table 3). None of the patients who did not have HBsAg decline >10% at week 12 achieved SVR. Although significant dynamic changes of IP-10 and IFN-γ levels from baseline to week 12 were noted, none of these factors were associated with SVR. In multivariate analysis, the on-treatment predictors of SVR were HBV DNA <2000 IU/mL and HBsAg decline >10% at week 12 (Table 3). In HBeAg-positive patients, only HBV DNA decline >2 Log10 was the on-treatment predictor SVR in uni- and multi-variate analyses (Table S1). In HBeAg-negative patients, HBsAg levels and HBsAg decline >10% correlated with SVR in univariate analysis, while HBsAg decline >10% was the only on-treatment predictor of SVR in multivariate analysis (Table S2). Baseline CXCL9 levels and on-treatment response We further analyzed the correlation between baseline CXCL9 levels and on-treatment viral suppression, determined by HBV DNA ever less than 20,000 IU/mL during PEG-IFN treatment. The mean baseline CXCL9 levels in patients with or without achieving HBV DNA <20,000 IU/mL during PEG-IFN treatment were 191.6 vs. 68.5 pg/mL, respectively (p=0.004). Among the 28 patients with baseline CXCL9 >80 pg/mL, 24 (85.7%) had ever achieved HBV DNA <20,000 IU/mL, whereas in the 46 patients with baseline CXCL9 <80 pg/mL, only 26 (56.5) had ever achieved HBV DNA <20,000 IU/mL (p=0.019). Predictive values of baseline CXCL9 levels on SVR In order to identify patients who had higher chance of SVR before PEG-IFN treatment, an algorithm based on combination of baseline serum CXCL9 and HBV DNA levels was established (Figure 3). Patients with baseline high viral loads generally had a low chance of SVR. Among 47 patients with low viral loads, 13 of 22 patients with CXCL9 >80 pg/mL achieved SVR (positive predictive value (PPV)=59.1%), whereas only 5 of 25 (20%) patients with CXCL9 <80 pg/mL had SVR (Figure 3A). The SVR rate was lowest (0%) in patients with baseline low CXCL9 levels but high viral loads (negative predictive value (NPV) = 100%). The predictive value of CXCL9 was not dominant in HBeAg-positive patients (Figure 3B), but the performance of CXCL9 in predicting SVR was good in HBeAg-negative patients with low viral loads (PPV=64.3%, Figure 3C). 10.1371/journal.pone.0076798.g003Figure 3 Prediction algorithm based on baseline serum CXCL9 level and HBV viral load. The prediction algorithm applied for all (A), HBeAg-positive (B) and HBeAg-negative CHB patients (C). Interferon therapy for CHB remains a clinical challenge. Although successful PEG-IFN treatment may induce a durable response and reduce liver-related complications, most of patients could not achieve virological response [10–13], and only a minority of patients choose PEG-IFN as initial antiviral treatment for CHB due to the concern of side effects in Taiwan. Therefore, individualized treatment strategies according to pretreatment and on-treatment parameters should be developed to identify patients with a highest chance of response. However, currently there is no ideal pre-treatment predictor of SVR, especially in HBeAg-negative patients. In this prospective pilot study, we demonstrated the dynamic changes of serum cytokines and chemokines during PEG-IFN therapy and showed that baseline CXCL9 level strongly correlated with SVR in patients with CHB.In the current study, the HBeAg seroconversion rate and SVR rate in HBeAg-positive patients receiving 24-week PEG-IFN treatment (33.3% and 20%, respectively) were comparable with the results reported in previous studies [11,33,34]. In HBeAg-negative patients, the SVR (31.6%) and HBsAg clearance (5.3%) rates were also consistent with those from the previous reports [35,36].Declines of serum IP-10 levels have been observed during PEG-IFN therapy in HBeAg-positive CHB patients [37]. In our study, we also observed a significant decline of IP-10 and IFN-γ levels 12 weeks after PEG-IFN treatment, which might reflect a lessened hepatic necro-inflammatory activity after treatment. Although there was no significant change in CXCL9 levels at week 12 in overall patients, patients with SVR had a significant early decline of CXCL9 levels while patients without SVR had a late CXCL9 levels decline (Figure 1). The early CXCL9 decline in patients with SVR might represent an early viral suppression, as supported by the positive correlations between early CXCL9 levels decline and declines of viral load and HBsAg levels. Unfortunately, the early CXCL9 decline could not accurately predict SVR (SVR rate of 35.3% and 17.4% in patients with and without early CXCL9 decline, respectively, p=0.240). Consistent with recent studies showing that HBsAg decline at week 12 strongly correlated with SVR [17,18,38], our data also demonstrated that none of the patients who did not have HBsAg decline >10% at week 12 achieved SVR in this study. HBsAg clearance is a benefit of interferon treatment. It will be interesting to define the relationship between the baseline level of HBsAg and HBsAg clearance, as well as the role of baseline level and dynamic changes of CXCL9 on HBsAg loss. However, during the limited follow-up period of this study, only 2 cases achieved HBsAg clearance. Further large long-term follow-up studies are needed to delineate the role of CXCL9 on HBsAg clearance.The finding that older patients have higher rates of SVR in univariate analysis might relate to lower viral loads in elder people. Although IL28B SNPs have been shown to predict SVR in patients with chronic hepatitis C and correlate with hepatitis activity in CHB [4,25–27], there was no correlation between IL28B SNPs and SVR in both HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative patients. The role of CXCL9 in CHB patients receiving PEG-IFN has not been reported before. CXCL9 and IP-10 were reported to correlate with hepatic injury during hepatic flares in CHB [19]. A strong correlation of serum CXCL9 and IP-10 concentrations with ALT levels was also noted [19]. Consistent with previous report, our results also showed positive correlations between CXCL9, IP-10 and ALT levels. The positive correlations between these parameters may imply that these chemokines have positive impact on the liver inflammation and HBV control, albeit the relevance was not good due to complex interactions between other host and viral factors that contribute the liver inflammation. These findings suggest that both CXCL9 and IP-10 are associated with hepatic necro-inflammation and may be surrogates of the host immune response against HBV infection. IP-10 has been shown to correlate with SVR to IFN-based therapy in patients with HCV infection [20–22]. Sonneveld, et al recently reported that high pretreatment serum IP-10 levels were associated with HBeAg loss after 52 weeks of PEG-IFN therapy in HBeAg-positive patients, albeit the predictive value for combined serological and virological response was less prominent [37]. Different HBV genotypes and duration of PEG-IFN treatment may influence the predictive role of IP-10 in HBeAg-positive patients.Baseline CXCL9 level significantly correlates not only with SVR, but also with on-treatment viral suppression. This finding supports a stronger host immune response at baseline having a higher chance of SVR under interferon treatment. A recent finding also showed that HBeAg-negative CHB patients with greater baseline HBV-specific CTL responses had a better on-treatment control of HBV replication during PEG-IFN treatment [39].CXCL9 and IP-10 are chemokines that bind to the cell surface chemokine receptor CXCR3, which is highly expressed on effector T cells and plays an important role in T cell trafficking and function [40,41]. An animal study showed that HBV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) induced CXCL9 and IP-10 production and subsequently recruited host inflammatory cells responsible for liver damage [42,43]. Lower levels of CXCL9 and IP-10 correlate with HBV persistence in an animal model [44]. In human study, elevated CXCL9 and IP-10 involve in liver inflammation during hepatitis flares in CHB [19]. Our results showed a positive correlation between CXCL9 and IP-10 levels, representing that both chemokines were induced and participated in immune responses against HBV infection. Although both CXCL9 and IP-10 are ligands of CXCR3, they have distinct properties. IP-10 is induced by a variety of innate stimuli that can further induce IFN-α/β, and is responsible for recruiting type-1 helper (Th1)-type CD4+ T cells, effector CD8+ T cells and innate-type lymphocytes, such as natural killer (NK) and NKT cells. In contrast, the induction of CXCL9 is restricted to IFN-γ, and its function is predominantly in recruiting CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes [41]. The underlying mechanism of CXCL9 level correlates with SVR deserves further study.The strong correlation of baseline CXCL9 levels with SVR indicates that CXCL9 might serve as a marker to select CHB patients suitable for PEG-IFN therapy, especially in HBeAg-negative cases with low viral loads. In contrast, the SVR rate in patients with high viral loads was low regardless of their baseline CXCL9 levels, suggesting that host antiviral immunity might be overwhelmed by high viral loads.As a pilot study, the case number was small. It was also due to fewer than 5% of CHB patients in Taiwan had the will to receive PEG-IFN as initial antiviral treatment. Therefore, it is important to identify a pre-treatment marker to predict response to PEG-IFN, not only to encourage patients to receive PEG-IFN treatment but also to save the medical resources for those with a high chance of response. Further large and long-term follow up studies are needed to determine the appropriate cutoff level of CXCL9, and to observe the predictive value of CXCL9 on delayed virological response and HBsAg clearance.In conclusion, CXCL9 might be used to select appropriate CHB patients to receive PEG-IFN treatment, especially in HBeAg-negative patients with low viral loads."
