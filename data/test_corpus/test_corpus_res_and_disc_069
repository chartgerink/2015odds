"GWAS and Replication Studies In the GWAS phase, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping was performed using the Illumina HumanHap610-Quad BeadChip for cases and the Illumina HumanHap550v3 BeadChip for controls. Genotype concordance between these two BeadChips was 99.99% among 182 duplicated samples, indicating the low possibility of genotyping error. 458,207 SNPs passed quality control filters and were analyzed using an additive model for genotype-phenotype association in 481 patients with chronic HCV infection and 2,963 controls. Principal component analysis revealed no population substructure in our population. In addition, a quantile-quantile plot using the results of the Cochran-Armitage trend test showed that the inflation factor, λ, was 1.007, indicating a low probability of false-positive associations resulting from population stratification (Figure S1A). Using the additive model, one SNP reached the genome-wide significance level for association after Bonferroni correction (calculated as P < 0.05/458,207 = P < 1.09 x 10-7), and another 24 SNPs showed suggestive association (P < 1 x 10-5) in our GWAS (Figure S1B and Table S1). Next, we conducted the first replication study to validate the results of the GWAS phase using 4,358 cases and 1,114 controls. We performed genotyping of 18 SNPs with P values < 1x10-5 in the GWAS phase, after excluding 7 SNPs with r2 = 1 in the same locus based on the HapMap-JPT database, and successfully genotyped all SNPs using multiplex PCR-based Invader assay (Table S2), except for rs9275563, which is moderately linked with rs9275572 (r2 = 0.56). Only rs9275572 in the HLA-DQ locus on chromosome 6 showed significant replication of the association (P < 0.05/17), and the association reached a genome-wide significance level when we combined the two studies using the Mantel-Haenszel method (P = 2.04 × 10−12, odds ratio [OR] = 0.75; Table 1). We further confirmed the association in 1,379 cases and 25,817 controls and found a highly significant association with chronic HCV after meta-analysis of all three studies (Pcombined = 3.59 × 10−16, OR = 0.79, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.75-0.84). As shown in Table 1, we observed no heterogeneity among the three studies (heterogeneity test P = 0.113). 10.1371/journal.pone.0084226.t001Table 1Summary of GWAS and replication studies.

Multiple Logistic Regression Analysis and Stratified Analysis We next evaluated the association in more detail using the first replication set. Both HCV case and healthy control samples were collected at Hiroshima University. After adjusting for gender and age using multiple logistic regression analysis, the rs9275572 C allele remained highly significant with an OR = 0.79 (95% CI 0.70-0.89) (Table S3). Our study also confirmed a stronger protective effect of female gender compared to male gender [12, 16]. Subsequently, we analyzed the effect of rs9275572 according to gender and age. As shown in Table S4A, we observed no significant difference between subgroups. In addition to host genetic factors, such as HLA alleles, the distribution of viral genotypes is also highly variable around the world, and it has been suggested that different HCV genotypes result in different clinical outcomes [17, 18]. For example, HCV genotype 1, the most common genotype in Japan, shows stronger resistance against IFN-based anti-viral therapy than HCV genotype 2, the second most frequently encountered genotype in Japan [19, 20]. Hence, we stratified HCV cases by HCV genotype and compared each with healthy controls. We observed that the effect tended to be slightly greater in genotype 1 (OR = 0.74 [0.66-0.82]) than genotype 2 (OR = 0.83 [0.74-0.94]), but there was no significant difference (heterogeneity test P = 0.127) (Table S4B). Detailed Analysis of HLA-DQ alleles Other than rs9275572, which is located within the HLA-DQ locus (Figure S2), several SNPs within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region showed suggestive associations but failed to be validated in a replication study. The linkage disequilibrium (LD) structure around the HLA-DQ region indicates that the landmark SNP is located in an LD block containing HLA-DQB1 and HLA-DQA1 (Figure 1 and Figure S3). Therefore, we next genotyped HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 alleles by direct sequencing of exon 2 using all 1,114 healthy controls of the first replication set and the same number of cases with HCV genotype 1 obtained from the same set and collected from the same geographical area. Over 95% of samples were successfully genotyped for each HLA-DQ, and common alleles with frequencies of more than 1 % were determined (7 and 11 alleles for HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1, respectively) (Table 2, Table S5A and S5B). Although no allele showed significant association (P < 0.05/7) among HLA-DQA1 alleles, the HLA-DQB1*0303 allele showed significant association among HLA-DQB1 alleles (P < 0.05/12, OR = 0.69). We also performed haplotype analysis using 1,025 cases and 1,038 controls that had been successfully genotyped for HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQB1 and rs9275572 to investigate the effects of haplotype combinations; however, no haplotype showed stronger association than the single association of HLA-DQB1*0303 (Table S6). In our Japanese cohort, DQB1*0303 was the most frequent of the DQB1*03 alleles and showed the strongest effect against HCV persistence, but we also found that all DQB1*03 alleles tended to have a protective effect. Hence, we speculate that not only DQB1*0303, but all DQB1*03 alleles share protective residues. We searched for a variant that is common to all DQB1*03 alleles but that differs from non-DQB1*03 alleles and found that SNP rs1130380 is a variant specific to DQB1*03 (Table S5A and S5B). Then, we evaluated the single marker effect of several nucleotide variants, which are useful to distinguish among common DQB1 alleles using the same individuals with the haplotype analysis, and finally determined that rs1130380 (P = 6.08 × 10−7, OR = 0.72) had a stronger effect than the landmark SNP, rs9275572 (P = 2.07 × 10−5, OR = 0.76) (Table S7). After mutual adjustment between rs1130380 and rs9275572 using multiple logistic regression analysis, the association for both variants was remarkably attenuated (P = 2.38 × 10−3 and P = 0.0534, respectively), suggesting their mutual linkage (D’ = 0.99, r2 = 0.28) (Figure S4). Therefore, these variants probably represent the same genetic signal and rs1130380 could be more compatible as a representative variant of the signal. This nucleotide polymorphism causes an amino acid substitution at position 55 on the HLA-DQB1 molecule. We examined the position of this amino acid substitution using on a three-dimensional structure of HLA-DQ molecule that was determined by X-ray diffraction method [21]. As shown in Figure S5, the amino acid at β55 forms part of a peptide-binding pocket in the HLA-DQ molecule, suggesting a critical role in antigen presentation. The change from Arg to Pro implies a physicochemcial change from basic to hydrophobic (Figure S6), but we have no relevant data with which to show a change of affinity to certain peptides at this time. Further functional analysis is therefore needed. 10.1371/journal.pone.0084226.g001Figure 1 Linkage disequilibrium structure around the HLA-DQ region based on D’ using HapMap-JPT Data.

Evaluation of IFNL3-IFNL4 locus in GWAS In spite of our failure to detect it in our GWAS screen, variants close to IFNL3 have been reported to be associated with spontaneous clearance of HCV, so we tried to confirm the association using our GWAS data. Because genotype data for rs12979860 was not available in our platform, we checked the genotype data using another frequently reported SNP, rs8099917, which is highly linked with rs12979860 in the Japanese population (r2 = 0.94) [22, 23]. As shown in Table S8, the association was confirmed in our GWAS set (P = 3.22 × 10−3, OR = 0.73) with the same allele conferring a protective effect. Analysis of IFNL3-IFNL4 locus and HLA-DQ*03 We genotyped a IFNL4 variant, ss469415590, and two representative variants close to IFNL3, rs12979860 and rs8099917, by Invader assay using the same individuals used in the detailed analysis of the HLA-DQ alleles above (1,114 cases and 1,114 controls). Each of these three polymorphisms were successfully genotyped in 1,074 cases and 1,073 controls. rs12979860 and ss469415590 were in almost complete LD, and ss469415590 showed the strongest association with HCV persistence under the additive model (P = 2.96 × 10−3, OR = 0.75) (Table 3). After adjusting for the effect of the HLA-DQ*03 allele using multiple logistic regression analysis, the significance level of ss469415590 increased slightly (P = 1.67 × 10−3, OR=0.74). We additionally analyzed the association under different genetic models other than additive. Among several genetic models, the IFNL4 variant, ss469415590, showed the strongest association under the recessive model for the protective allele (the dominant model for the risk allele), whereas rs1130380 showed the strongest association under the allelic model (Table S9). We further evaluated the effect of the DQB1*03 allele stratified by ss469415590 genotype (Table 4). Interestingly, DQB1*03 showed a stronger effect in individuals with the ss469415590-TT/TT genotype, and this tendency became more pronounced for rs9275572, the landmark SNP in our GWAS (heterogeneity test P = 2.45 × 10−3). 10.1371/journal.pone.0084226.t003Table 3 Case-control association analysis of 5 variants using 1,074 chronic hepatitis C cases and 1,073 healthy controls.

The MHC region containing the HLA locus is widely believed to play an important role in viral infection, and a recent GWAS revealed a strong association between the HLA-DP and DQ locus and hepatitis B virus (HBV) persistence [24, 25] as well as HBV-induced HCC [26] in East Asia. In our GWAS with two replication studies, we aimed to clarify the genetic factors involved in chronic HCV infection, and we successfully identified an association with the HLA-DQB1 locus based on the landmark SNP rs9275572. An association between the MICA locus and the risk of developing HCV-induced HCC was previously reported in a Japanese GWAS [27], and this study identified rs9275572 as a second associated SNP. HCV-positive cases in the previous study, which are independent of ours, showed a similar minor allele frequency (MAF) of rs9275572 to our cases (0.407 in GWAS stage and 0.429 in replication stage), which strongly supports our results. Furthermore, according to the 1000 Genomes database, the MAF of this SNP is 0.348 in the Japanese population, which is consistent with the MAF of our controls.On the other hand, while we observed no significant heterogeneity across the three studies, there were some differences in MAF among studies in both case and control populations. For both cases and controls, MAFs were lower in the first replication study than in the other two studies. Among the three studies, only the first replication set was collected from the same geographical area, therefore, geographical differences might affect the differences in MAF among studies, but this is only speculation. There are also differences in the gender and age distribution among studies (Table S10). Nonetheless, it is difficult to find a suitable explanation for the differences in MAF at this time.In the current study, we failed to detect the previously most replicated IFNL3-IFNL4 locus during GWAS screening even though the association indeed existed in our GWAS set (P = 3.22 × 10−3, OR = 0.73; Table S8). The odds ratio for rs8099917 is nearly the same as for rs9275572, but the P values were quite different, with rs9275572 ranked in the top 9 candidate SNPS, whereas the other is far below at number 1,640. This crucial difference may be explained by differences in allele frequencies. The minor allele frequency of rs9275572 is over three times higher than that of rs8099917, and the statistical power to detect each SNP in our GWAS was calculated to be only 65% and 8%, respectively, compared to the 80% recommended to detect an association of the expected effect size. We are concerned that there are several remaining undetected SNPs that might affect HCV persistence or clearance, in addition to the IFNL3-IFNL4 locus. To overcome this problem, it will be necessary to use a larger sample size, as well as more appropriate control samples. In fact, the major limitation of our study involves the selection of controls. Undoubtedly, the most appropriate control set would include patients who have been exposed to HCV (anti-HCV positive) but who spontaneously cleared the infection (HCV-RNA negative). Although the risk of exposure to HCV in the Japanese general population is very low, making it difficult to locate suitable control subjects, we admit concede that our choice of study design has reduced the statistical power of the study and might have undermined the conclusions.HLA-DQs belong to the HLA class II molecules that form α-β heterodimers on the cell surface of antigen-presenting cells, such as macrophages, dendritic cells and B lymphocytes. HLA-DQ genes play a central role in immune-mediated diseases by presenting peptides derived from extracellular proteins to CD4-positive T lymphocytes. Both HLA-DQB1 and HLA-DQA1 are highly polymorphic, especially in exon 2, which encodes antigen-binding sites that confer binding specificity. We speculated that the association of the landmark SNP with chronic hepatitis C might reﬂect variation in HLA-DQ antigen-binding sites and that somewhat different effects of rs9275572 between HCV genotypes might reflect differences in binding affinities between the HLA-DQ pocket and HCV genotype-specific epitopes (Table S4B). Finally, we found that a single amino acid polymorphism (R55P) corresponding to DQB1*03, a very common allele worldwide [28], has the strongest protective effect against HCV persistence. Among DQB1*03 alleles, DQB1*0301 has the highest frequency various populations worldwide and has been reported in association with viral clearance in several European and American studies [7, 13]. A suggestive paper by Cangussu et al. found an association between protection against HCV persistence and not only DQB1*0301 but also DQB1*0302 and DQB1*0303 in a white Brazilian cohort [29]. They suggested that HLA-DQ beta molecules responsible for protection are present not only in molecules encoded by DQB1*0301 but also by DQB1*0302 and DQB1*0303, and the common polymorphic residues shared by DQB1*03 alleles are responsible for the selection of particular HCV epitopes. In the current study, we identified that not only the allele with the strongest effect, DQB1*0303, but all DQB1*03 alleles share protective residues at position 55 in at least the Japanese and white Brazilian populations. Although the human MHC region encompasses a complex and extended LD structure, and LD among SNPs in the HLA-class II locus is known to vary among ethnic populations, various immunological functions of MHC molecules have gradually become clear. Several issues had to be overcome in order improve our understanding of whether or not the HLA-DQB1 molecule has common functions across multiple populations.In this study, we also made an intriguing observation that HLA-DQB1*03 showed a stronger effect in individuals with the ss469415590-TT/TT genotype (Table 4), suggesting that the effect of HLA-DQB1*03 on HCV persistence might be affected by the genotype of the IFNL4 polymorphism. The fact that in the Japanese population the frequency of the ss469415590-TT/TT genotype is nearly equal to that of the rs12979860-CC genotype (JPT 78.7%, CEU 57.6%, AFR 15.4% based on the 1000 Genomes database), with a higher frequency than most other populations, might partially explain the differences among the top loci in European versus Japanese GWAS results. Finally, we determined the relationship between HLA-DQB1*03 (rs1130380) and IFNL4 variants (ss469415590) in cases and controls (Figure S7A and S7B). In cases, the proportion of individuals with the protective ss469415590-TT/TT genotype significantly increased while the proportion of protective DQB1*03 alleles decreased, but this tendency was not observed in controls. During any phase of HCV infection, these two polymorphisms might affect each other in complementary or exclusive fashion.A recent GWAS reported that variants close to IFNL3 and DQB1*0301 are independently associated with spontaneous resolution of HCV infection [13]. On the other hand, our study newly suggests that a single amino acid polymorphism, common throughout the world, at position 55 on the HLA-DQB1 molecule has the strongest association with chronic HCV infection and may not be independent of the IFNL4 polymorphism.In summary, we conducted a GWAS followed by two independent replication studies and detected genetic variants in the HLA-DQ genes strongly associated with chronic hepatitis C in the Japanese population. Our findings suggest that variation in antigen-binding sites involved in antigen presentation on HLA-DQ molecules might play an important role in HCV persistence or clearance. Further research is required to determine the distinct roles of HLA-DQB1 and IFNL4 in chronic HCV infection."
