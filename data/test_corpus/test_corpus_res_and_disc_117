"Efficacy and Tolerability of 1(OH) Vitamin D3 Combined with Peg-IFN/RBV Therapy
The characteristics of 42 patients treated with 1(OH) vitamin D3 (1 µg/day)/Peg-IFN/RBV therapy are shown in Table 1. The subjects enrolled in this study were 29 to 71 years old. 13 patients were previously treated with IFN-based therapy and failed to achieve SVR. Another 29 patients were treatment naïve. Case match control subjects treated with Peg-IFN/RBV therapy were enrolled in this study (Fig. 1) (Table 1). All of the enrolled patients had over 5 log copies/ml HCV-RNA and genotype 1b HCV RNA. Thirteen patients had the hetero/minor IL28B allele (T/G) (rs8099917) that was reported to be a marker of patients difficult-to-treat with Peg-IFN/RBV therapy [29]. Twenty-nine patients had the major homo IL28B allele (T/T) that was reported to be favorable for achieving SVR [29]. Therefore, we compared the viral dynamics between subjects treated with the 1(OH) vitamin D3/Peg-IFN/RBV and subjects receiving the Peg-IFN/RBV with the same IL28B polymorphism (Fig. 2A and B). The titers of HCV-RNA in the IL28B (T/T)-HCV patients treated with 1(OH) vitamin D3/Peg-IFN/RBV therapy were significantly lower than those treated with Peg-IFN/RBV at 4 weeks after the start of Peg-IFN/RBV therapy (p<0.01). The rate of early virological response in the IL28B (T/T) patients treated with 1(OH) vitamin D3/Peg-IFN/RBV was significantly higher than that in those treated with Peg-IFN/RBV alone (Fig. 2C). None of the patients showed side effects from 1(OH) vitamin D3 administration such as hypercalcemia or renal dysfunction, etc. The rate of the sustained virological response (SVR) in the overall patients treated with 1(OH) vitamin D3/Peg-IFN/RBV was 59.45% (45.24% in the overall patients treated with Peg-IFN/RBV) (p = 0.2059) The rate of SVR in the IL28B (T/T) patients treated with 1(OH) vitamin D3/Peg-IFN/RBV was 73.07% (55.17% in IL28B (T/T) patients treated with Peg-IFN/RBV) (p = 0.1657). However, this study was conducted to analyze the immunological response during the early phase of Peg-IFN/RBV. The sample size might not be large enough to analyze the SVR rate.

Biological Effect of 1(OH) Vitamin D3 Treatment during Peg-IFN/RBV Therapy
The biochemical and hematological analysis was carried out at 4 weeks before the start of Peg-IFN/RBV therapy and at the start of Peg-IFN/RBV therapy. Of those data, only the absolute counts of white blood cells were significantly decreased after 4 weeks-1(OH) vitamin D3-treatment (p<0.05) (Fig. 3). The titers of HCV-RNA were not significantly changed after the 4-week administration of 1(OH) vitamin D3 without Peg-IFN/RBV therapy. Therefore, we examined the immunological effects of 1(OH) vitamin D3. At first, we quantitated 10 cytokines (IL 4, IL 6, IL10, IL12, IL17, IFN-γ, IP-10, MCP-1, RANTES, TNF-α) in the peripheral blood samples during 1(OH) vitamin D3/Peg-IFN/RBV therapy using multiple beads suspension array (Fig. 4A and Fig. S1). Among the IL28B T/T polymorphism patients, the amounts of IL4, IP-10 and MCP1 in the peripheral blood serum were significantly reduced after 4-week-1(OH) vitamin D3-treatment. On the other hand, the amounts of IL6, RANTES and TNF-α in the serum were significantly increased after 4-week 1(OH)vitamin D3 treatment. In the IL28B T/G or G/G polymorphism patients, the amount of RANTES in the serum was significantly increased after 4-week 1(OH) vitamin D3-treatment. The amounts of IL4, IFN-γ, IP-10, MCP-1 in the serum were significantly decreased after 4-week 1(OH) vitamin D3-treatment. The administration of 1 (OH) vitamin D3 could reduce the high IP-10 status that is reported to be difficult-to-treat. Then, we compared the amounts of 10 cytokines between 1(OH) vitamin D3/Peg-IFN/RBV group and Peg-IFN/RBV group at 0 week and 12 weeks after the Peg-IFN/RBV treatment. The amounts of cytokines in the patients treated with 1(OH) vitamin D3/Peg-IFN/RBV at 0 week were affected by 4 weeks 1(OH) vitamin D3 pre-treatment. The amounts of IP-10 in the patients treated with 4 weeks-1(OH) vitamin D3 were significantly lower than those in the group treated without 1(OH) vitamin D3. However, the amounts of IFN-gamma and RANTES in the IL28B TT patients treated with 1(OH) vitamin D3/Peg-IFN/RBV were significantly higher than those in the IL28B TT patients treated with Peg-IFN/RBV without 1(OH) vitamin D3 at 12 weeks after the start of Peg-IFN/RBV treatment (Fig. 4B). In addition to the absolute amounts of several cytokines, the changes in the amounts after the 12 weeks Peg-IFN/RBV treatment were analyzed (Fig. 4B and Fig. S2). Changes in the amounts of IL4, IL-12, IFN-gamma and RANTES during the 12 weeks-treatment of Peg-IFN/RBV were significantly different between the 1(OH) vitamin D3/Peg-IFN/RBV group and Peg-IFN/RBV group (p<0.05) (Fig. 4B and Fig. S2). The Biological Effects of 1(OH)vitamin D3 and 1,25(OH)2 Vitamin D3 on the Production of Cytokines from PBMCs
Then, we examined whether the administration of 1(OH) vitamin D3 could affect the production of various kinds of cytokines from PBMCs. We used trans-well systems to analyze the effects of hepatocytes with various kinds of enzymes that affect the metabolism of 1(OH) vitamin D3 (Fig. 4C). We used a ng/ml order of calcitriol(1,25(OH)2 vitamin D3) as the active form of vitamin D3 and a µg/ml order of 1(OH) vitamin D3 as the pre-active form of vitamin D3 with or without IFN-α (0.025 ng/ml). The amounts of IL4, IL6, IFN-γ, IP-10 and TNF-α were significantly decreased by the active and pre-active form of vitamin D3 without IFN-α (Fig. 4D). Among them, the amount of IP-10 was dose-dependently decreased by 1(OH)vitamin D3 and 1,25(OH)2vitamin D3 without IFN-α. On the other hand, the amount of RANTES was dose-dependently increased by 1(OH)vitamin D3 and 1,25 (OH)2 vitamin D3 with or without IFN-α. The amounts of IL10 and IFN-γ were significantly increased by 1(OH)vitamin D3 and 1,25(OH)2vitamin D3 with IFN-α (Fig. 4D). These data indicated that 1(OH)vitamin D3 and 1,25(OH)2vitamin D3 could modulate the immunological status of PBMCs, especially the down-regulation of IP-10 production. Comparison of the Frequency of Th1 and Tregs between 1(OH) Vitamin D3/Peg-IFN/RBV and Peg-IFN/RBV
Sequential analyses of CD3+CD4+CXCR3+CCR5+(Th1 cells) and CD3+CD4+CD25+CD127− (Tregs) were carried out during 1(OH) vitamin D3/Peg-IFN/RBV or Peg-IFN/RBV treatment. Representative dot plots indicating Th1 and Tregs are shown (Fig. 5A). The subsets of these cells could be clearly recognized by flow cytometry. Four-week treatment of 1(OH) vitamin D3 could significantly decrease the frequency of Th1 cells but not Tregs (p<0.05) (Fig. 5B). However, the frequency of Th1 cells was rapidly increased after the start of Peg-IFN/RBV therapy, especially in the IL28B T/T subjects treated with 1(OH) vitamin D3/Peg-IFN/RBV therapy (Fig. 5B and C). The frequency of Th1 cells in the subjects treated with 1(OH) vitamin D3 was significantly higher than in those treated with Peg-IFN/RBV at 12 weeks after the Peg-IFN/RBV therapy, especially in the IL28B T/T patients (Fig. 5C). Moreover, the expression of IFN-γ and T-bet mRNA in the isolated CD4+ cells of subjects treated with 1(OH) vitamin D3/Peg-IFN/RBV therapy was significantly higher than in those treated with Peg-IFN/RBV therapy at 4 weeks and 12 weeks after Peg-IFN/RBV therapy (Fig. 5D). Changes in ISG mRNA Expression in Liver with 1(OH) Vitamin D3 Treatment
The administration of 1(OH) vitamin D3 could reduce various kinds of cytokines in the serum. Therefore, we carried out quantification of ISG mRNA in samples from liver biopsies (Fig. 6A). We selected the Mx, IFI44, IFIT1 genes among the various kinds of ISGs, since another group previously reported that these ISGs could clearly recognize patients as difficult-to treat or easy-to-treat with IFN-based therapy [30]. The expression level of ISGs in the IL28B TT polymorphism was significantly lower than in the IL28B TG or GG polymorphism. Moreover, the expression levels of liver ISGs in the CH-C patients receiving 4 week-administration of 1(OH) vitamin D3 were significantly lower than those in the CHC patients without administration of 1(OH) vitamin D3. Direct Effect of Vitamin D on the Expression of ISGs in Hepatocyte without Immune Cells
We used Huh-7 cells with a JFH-1 system that mimicks the acute phase of ISG induction in HCV infection, since we wanted to determine whether 1 (OH) vitamin D3 and 1, 25 (OH)2 vitamin D3 could affect the ISG expression directly. Three representative ISGs (MxA, IFI44 and IFIT1) were analyzed by real-time PCR. JFH-1 replication could induce these ISGs in Huh-7 cells (Fig.6 B). We used 1(OH) vitamin D3 and 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D3 to analyze the ISG expression after JFH-1 inoculation. These ISGs were not affected by 1(OH) vitamin D3, and 1, 25(OH)2 vitamin D3 in vitro.
Recently, it has been reported that supplementation of vitamin D3, a potent immunomodulator, could improve the HCV response to antiviral therapy [2], [3], [31]. We used 1(OH) vitamin D3, since hepatocytes have various kinds of enzymes to convert 1(OH) vitamin D3 to the active metabolite 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D3. Therefore, we speculated that the administration of 1(OH) vitamin D3 could affect the liver adaptive immune cells since the local concentration of 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D3 might be higher than the systemic concentration of this active metabolite. Another group reported that 25(OH) vitamin D3, but not vitamin D3 or 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D3, could have direct-antiviral activity at the level of infectious virus assembly [7]. However, the antiviral activity of 25(OH) vitamin D3 is not so remarkable. Moreover, the system of HCV replication in that study did not include the immune cells that are important for the control of HCV replication [32]–[35].In this study, we first reported that administration of 1(OH) vitamin D3 could affect the cytokine production from PBMCs and suppress the ISGs mRNA expression in the liver samples. Among the various kinds of cytokines, IP-10, which was reported to be an important biomarker for the treatment response, could be significantly decreased after 1(OH) vitamin D3 treatment in vivo [36], [37]. It has been reported that a high amount of IP-10 is a promising biomarker for difficult-to-treat patients regardless of the IL28B polymorphism [36], [37]. IP-10 can be produced from various kinds of immune cells including monocytes. In this study, we found that calcitriol could reduce the production of IP-10 from PBMCs dose-dependently in vitro. In addition to the production of IP-10, the expression of ISG mRNA in the liver biopsy samples with 1(OH) vitamin D3 treatment was significantly lower than in those without 1(OH) vitamin D3 treatment regardless of the IL28B polymorphism. The excessive expression of ISG mRNA before the Peg-IFN/RBV therapy might induce a poor response to IFN administration [38], [39]. In addition to these results, we confirmed that the amounts of IFN-gamma and RANTES induced by 12-weeks 1 (OH) vitamin D3/Peg-IFN/RBV treatment was significantly higher than those induced by 12 weeks Peg-IFN/RBV treatment without 1 (OH) vitamin D3. 1 (OH) vitamin D3 could suppress the basal levels of the immune response in the CH-C patients. However, the subsequent response of the adaptive immune system after the start of Peg-IFN/RBV treatment could have been augmented by 1(OH) vitamin D3. These data indicated that calcitriol might be able to stabilize the adaptive immune systems that were out of control in CH-C patients instead of inducing their activation. In this study, we could not detect a significantly higher rate of SVR in the 1(OH) vitamin D3/Peg-IFN/RBV group in comparison with those in the Peg-IFN/RBV group. However, the addition of 1(OH) vitamin D3 could improve the adaptive immune response. Therefore, the SVR rate in the 1(OH) vitamin D3/Peg-IFN/RBV group might have been significantly higher than in the Peg-IFN/RBV group, if the sample size had been large enough to analyze the SVR.In addition to previous reports, our data indicated that calcitriol could affect the production of cytokines from PBMCs [25], [40]. However, we could not exclude the possibility of affecting cytokines other than the 10 cytokines we analyzed in this study. Moreover, other groups reported that vitamin D3 might modulate the expression of TLRs and/or their signaling, which are important in the immunopathogenesis of hepatitis C virus persistent infection [6], [14], [41]. This study was not a randomized control trial and did not have a large number of patients, since it focused on the effect of 1,25 (OH)2 Vitamin D3 on the immune cells. For this purpose, the number of included patients was sufficient for the analysis. Moreover, we are conducting a randomized control trial that includes a large number of chronic hepatitis C patients with sever fibrosis and low vitamin D3 concentrations (ongoing study) (UMIN000007400).In conclusion, the active metabolite of vitamin D3, calcitriol, could improve the response to Peg-IFN/RBV therapy. Supplementation of 1(OH) vitamin D3 or 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D3 should be reasonable for the conditioning of IFN-based treatment including Direct Acting Antiviral (DAA)/Peg-IFN/RBV, DAA/Peg-IFN, Peg-IFN/RBV and Peg-IFN monotherapy."
