"rs12979860 CC genotype is the most powerful predictor among SNPs of IL28B for RVR, EVR, ETR and SVR in chronic GT1 HCV infected patients treated with PegIFN/RBV Demographic characteristics of 191 CHC genotype-1 (GT1) patients enrolled in this prospective cohort were shown in Table 1. Among these patients, 133 (69.63%) achieved RVR, 183 (95.81%) achieved EVR and 131 (68.59%) achieved SVR (Figure 1). From the result of statistic analysis, the factors favoring SVR were low baseline viral load (HCV-RNA <0.4×106 IU/mL), less fibrosis stage (Metavir fibrosis score F0–F2), low body mass index (BMI), lower gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), RVR and EVR (Table 1). Ten SNPs of IL28B genetic variations were genotyped in each patient. Two loci, rs8103142 and rs28416813, were excluded from this analysis due to significant deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in genotype and allele distributions. In addition, one haplotype block consisting of 3 SNPs, rs11881222, rs4803219 and rs12979860, was identified due to strong evidence of linkage disequilibrium (Figure 2) and rs12979860 was chosen to represent this haplotype. In all the six SNPs under analysis, five SNPs were significantly associated with SVR except rs10853728 (Figure 3). 10.1371/journal.pone.0018322.g002 Figure 2 Pairwise linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns for eight polymorphisms through IL28B regions (chromosome 19, nucleotide positions 44,426,620–44,436,990). 10.1371/journal.pone.0018322.g003 Figure 3 IL28B genetic association with sustained virological response in patients with GT1-HCV infection treated with PegIFN/RBV.

We then examined the predictive ability of each SNP and other clinical baseline parameters for SVR by logistic regression (Table 2). Interestingly, only the rs12972860 CC genotype, but not other SNPs, together with younger age and low baseline viral load (<0.4×106 IU/ml) became the significant predictors for SVR by the multivariate analysis (Table 2). However, TT genotype of rs8099917 was also known as another important predictor for SVR [19], [20], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29]. We reasoned that the impact of rs12979860 was too strong to mask the effect of genotype of rs8099917 on SVR. Therefore, we omitted the data of rs12979860 and re-analyzed. As shown in Table 3, without the factor of rs12979860, the TT genotype of rs8099917, together with younger age and low baseline viral load emerged the significant predictors for SVR by the multivariate analysis. As for the RVR, it is also the same SNP, rs12972860, and baseline viral load could predict RVR by multivariate analyses (Table 4). For the EVR and ETR, only rs12979860 was the predictor but not the baseline viral load (Table 5 and 6). 10.1371/journal.pone.0018322.t002Table 2 Factors predicted SVR to Peg-IFN/RBV treatment in genotype I chronic hepatitis C patients by univariate and multivariate Logistic regression analysis.

Because IL28B is one of the cytokines that play an important role in anti-viral immunity, we then analyzed the relationship between these SNPs and the baseline viral load and stages of liver fibrosis. As show in Table 7, none of these SNPs correlated with the baseline viral load and fibrosis stage. We also studied the influence of the IL28B genotype on the SVR in patients with either high baseline viral load or low baseline viral load. Because rs12979860 is the single statistically significant IL28B predictor of SVR as shown previously, we focused on this locus in the groups of either high or low baseline viral load. As shown in Table 8, the genotype of rs12979860 was significantly associated with the SVR in both groups of high baseline viral load or low baseline viral load. Furthermore, the odds ratios between these two groups had no difference (Odds ratio, low viral load vs. high viral load: 6.37 vs.5.99, p = 0.956, by Cochran's and Mantel-Haenszel statistics). Therefore, in addition to the findings that this SNP had no relationship with baseline viral load, the impact of the SNP on SVR remained similar either in the group of high baseline viral load or low baseline viral load. 10.1371/journal.pone.0018322.t007Table 7 Influences of SNPs of IL28B on the baseline viral load and liver fibrosis.

In the present study, for patients with RVR, SVR was achieved in 79.0% of the instances, significantly higher than patients without RVR (SVR: 44.83%, P <0.001). We evaluated the influence of these SNPs on the SVR in these two groups of patients. In patients with RVR, only low baseline viral load was a significant predictor for SVR but not any SNPs of IL28B or other clinical parameters (Table 9). On the contrary, in patients without RVR, only CC genotype of rs12979860 could predict the SVR but not other clinical parameters including baseline viral load (Table 10). 10.1371/journal.pone.0018322.t009Table 9 Factors predicted SVR to Peg-IFN/RBV treatment in patients with RVR by univariate and multivariate Logistic regression analysis.

In addition, rs12979860 genotype could predict the SVR in patients without RVR but could not in patients with RVR. Four seminal papers had recently revealed a significant impact of IL28B polymorphisms on the treatment outcome of patients with chronic hepatitis C [17], [18], [19], [20]. Subsequently, several investigators also published similar observations in different populations different loci of SNPs of IL28B [21], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35]. Herein, we extended these observations and demonstrated that rs12972860 is the most powerful SNP predictor for RVR, EVR, ETR and SVR in patients of CHC genotype 1 treated with PegIFN/RBV. Furthermore, we also demonstrated that this SNP could only predict the SVR in patients without RVR but could not predict the SVR in patients with RVR.Based on previous reports on the SNPs of IL28B [17], [18], [19], [20], we had genotyped ten different SNPs of IL28B in our patient cohort. These ten SNPs were most strongly associated with SVR and were also found at the IFN-λ gene cluster [17], [18], [19], [20]. We excluded two loci, rs8103142 and rs28416813, from analysis due to significant deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in genotype and allele distributions. One of these two loci, rs8103142, was a nonsynonymous SNP, within the IL28B gene that encodes a lysine to arginine substitution at position 70 (K70R). Another locus, rs28416813, was a G to C substitution at 37 base pairs upstream of the translation initiation site[23]. In addition, we also found one haplotype block and we chose rs12979860 to represent this haplotype because this locus was frequently reported in previous literatures [17], [18], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35]. In total, 5 SNPs were significantly correlated with the SVR except one SNP, rs10853728, which was not. This SNP, rs10853728, had been reported to be associated with SVR in Japanese population with GT1 HCV infection [19] but was not associated with RVR and SVR in Taiwanese patients with GT2/3 HCV infection [36].However, we found the genotype of rs12979860, but not other SNPs, together with age and viral load became the predictors of SVR. rs12979860 is the frequently mentioned SNP of IL28B related to SVR [17], [18], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], and represents a haplotype block. rs8099917 was another frequently reported SNP for SVR in GT1 HCV infected patients [19], [20], [25], [26], [27], [28]. rs12979860 and rs8099917 reside 3 and 8 kilobases, respectively, upstream of the IL28B gene encoding IFN-λ-3 [23]. In our analysis, rs8099917 became the predictor for SVR only after omitting the data of rs12979860. Therefore, though several SNPs of IL28B had been claimed to be important for predicting SVR, it is clear the rs12979860 is the key predictor among these SNPs for SVR in GT1 HCV infected patients.Concerning the relationship between baseline viral load and SNPs of IL28B, the results from previous reports were not consistent. Some reports claimed the baseline viral load was correlated with the genotype of the SNP but others did not [17], [28], [32], [34], [37]. Our data showed no relationship between baseline viral load and the SNPs. In addition, we also demonstrated that in both groups of high viral load and low viral load, SNP of IL28B could predict the SVR with similar predictive ability. Therefore, in our cohort, SNP of IL28B was only related to the treatment outcome but was not related to the viral load.A customized therapy for chronic hepatitis C based on genotype and treatment viral response is the current treatment strategy [1], [2]. RVR is a useful predictor of SVR in treatment of chronic hepatitis C with either conventional IFN or PegIFN plus RBV therapies [5], [10], [11], [38]. As for the predictor of RVR, previous reports have shown baseline viral load was the single predictor [38], or together with younger age, lower body weight and absence of advanced fibrosis as predictors [5], [13], [39]. In the present study, we found baseline viral load was the only clinical parameter as the predictor for RVR. As for the SNPs of IL28B, it is again the rs12979860, but not other SNPs, that was the predictor for RVR. On the other hand, EVR was also an important negative response guider for treatment[16]. In previous reports, only the baseline viral load could predict the EVR [40]. In the present analysis, only rs12979860 but not other SNPs nor other clinical parameters, including baseline viral load, was the predictor for EVR. These results again emphasized the significant impact of this SNP to the treatment responses. Taken together, only the genotype of rs12979860 is the predictor for RVR, EVR, ETR and SVR. These results are consistent with the idea that SNPs of IL28B is related to the immune responses after interferon-plus RBV treatment [41].Another interesting observation in our study was the different impact of the CC genotype of rs12979860 on the SVR in patients with or without RVR. In patients with RVR, only baseline viral load but not the genotype of rs12979860 could predict the SVR. This is an interesting observation. The possible explanation is the CC genotype of rs12979860 led to the RVR with odds ratio of 10.52. As a result, the majority of patients with RVR were CC genotypes. Therefore, the CC genotype lost their predictive ability for SVR in this patient group with high prevalence of CC genotype. On the contrary, in patients without RVR, only the genotype of rs12979860 but not the baseline viral load could predict the SVR. This group of patients without RVR was with lower prevalence of CC genotype. Therefore, the CC genotype could continue its influence and therefore predict the SVR in this group of patients. This observation was quite similar to the recent report about genotype 2/3 HCV infected patients who received treatment that the genotype of rs12979860 is a single predictor for SVR in patients without RVR [35].Since the discovery of the strong association between SNPs of IL28B and treatment outcome of chronic hepatitis C, a consideration of personalized approach for treatment of chronic hepatitis C based on these SNPs had been proposed [22]. As suggested by Dr. Afdhal et al, although IL28B genotyping is highly predictive of SVR in HCV GT1 infected patients, its predictive power at the individual patient level is far from absolute. Therefore, IL28B genotyping should not be the sole factor in deciding on a treatment strategy [45]. In addition, shortening of treatment duration based on these SNPs together with other clinical parameter is possible but there are insufficient data to make recommendations [45]. However, the predictive ability of IL28B genotypes is strong enough. Therefore, it is reasonable to recommend a pre-treatment genotyping for SVR prediction. Based on our results described previously, we suggested genotyping for rs12979860 rather than other SNPs of IL28B would be a suitable genetic testing before starting treatment for patients with GT1-HCV chronic infection.On the other hand, though a strong association between IL28B polymorphism and SVR had been repeated reported, the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. Recent in-vitro report had shown that IL28B could inhibit HCV replication in a dose- and time- dependent manner and through the JAK-STAT pathway [42]. Consequently, it had been found that IL28B genotype is associated with differential expression of intrahepatic interferon-stimulated genes in patients with chronic hepatitis C [43]. Furthermore, serum IL-28A/B levels were significantly higher in patients with chronic hepatitis C with good allele of IL28B genotype [44]. All these evidences indicate both direct anti-viral effect and immune-mediated effect of IL28B could be affected by these polymorphisms. However, detailed mechanistic understanding needs further investigation.The limitation of this study was the retrospective nature of the analysis. However, it is common to all the papers published on this issue. The other limitation was that we had excluded the patients who didn't adhere to the 80/80/80 principle in order to investigate the real effects of SNPs on the treatment response. However, this exclusion would possibly ignore the possibilities that some patients without 80/80/80 adherence were due to the effect of these SNPs though till now there was no such report. Prospective controlled studies would be necessary to evaluate the influence of different SNPs of IL28B gene, especially rs12979869 and rs8077717, on treatment outcome of patients with chronic hepatitis C.In conclusion, our data demonstrated that the genotype of rs12979860 is the most powerful predictor for RVR, EVR, ETR and SVR among ten SNPs of IL28B in patients with GT1 HCV infection treated with PegIFN/RBV. Furthermore, we also demonstrated different impact of baseline viral load and genotype of rs12979860 on SVR in patients with or without RVR. Based on these results, we suggested that the genotyping of rs12979860 is the suitable target for genetic testing before treatment for patients with GT1-HCV chronic infection."
