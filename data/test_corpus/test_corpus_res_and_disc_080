RVR was achieved in 22.5% (148/659) of the overall cohort. Age was lower in patients with RVR (43.3 ± 8.9 vs. 46.7 ± 8.6; p < 0.001). Co-infected patients showed a lower prevalence of RVR than mono-infected patients [10% (17/170) vs. 26.8% (131/489); p < 0.001]. RVR was higher in HCV genotype 4 than in HCV genotype 1 [29.8% (37/124) vs. 20.7% (111/535); p < 0.05]. Thus, HCV genotype 4 reached RVR in 45.2% (33/73) vs. 23.6% (98/416) in HCV genotype 1 (p < 0.001) in mono-infected patients (Fig 2). IL28B-CC showed RVR in 38% (90/237) of patients while the IL28B-CT/TT showed 13.2% (53/402) RVR response (p < 0.001). Insulin resistance was associated with lower RVR [19% (47/248) vs. 28.8% (38/132); p < 0.05)]. Conversely, cirrhotic patients had less RVR than non-cirrhotic patients [12.9% (13/101) vs. 24.1% (123/511; p < 0.05]. HVL was related to less RVR [13.1% (51/388) vs. 35.9% (97/270); p < 0.001]. FIB-4, APRI and Forns’ index were significantly decreased (p < 0.001) in patients with RVR. 10.1371/journal.pone.0122613.g002

In multivariate analyses, variables associated with RVR were: LVL [Odds Ratio: 4.54 (95%CI: 2.47–8.34); p < 0.001], HIV co-infection [OR: 0.45 (95%CI: 0.22–0.91); p = 0.027], IL28B-CC [OR: 7.81 (95%CI: 4.29–14.38); p < 0.001], Genotype 1 [OR: 0.42 (95%CI: 0.21–0.81); p = 0.01], Forns’ Index [OR: 0.71 (95%CI: 0.60–0.83); p < 0.001] (Table 3). The AUROC for RRVR was 0.83 (95%CI 0.79–0.87; p < 0.001) and the cut-off 0.248 showed a sensitivity of 76%, specificity of 75%, positive predictive value of 47% and negative predictive value of 91%. This model was confirmed in the validation cohort, except for the HCV genotype., with an AUROC of 0.82 (95%CI: 0.76–0.88; p < 0.001) (Fig 3) and a cut-off 0.248 showing a sensitivity of 69%, specificity of 77%, positive predictive value of 43% and negative predictive value of 91%. 10.1371/journal.pone.0122613.t003

D1L was reached in 80.2% (509/635) of the overall cohort. Co-infected patients showed a lower prevalence of D1L than mono-infected patients [70.2% (118/168) vs. 83.7% (391/467); p < 0.001]. IL28B-CC had 93.8% (211/225) D1L, while IL28B-CT/TT had 72.4% (284/392) D1L (p < 0.001). D1L was higher in HCV genotype 1 than in HCV genotype 4 [81.7% (425/520) vs. 73% (84/115); p < 0.05). However, neither mono-infected (p = 0.831) nor co-infected patients (p = 0.098) showed statistically significant differences when segregated with respect to HCV genotype. Cirrhotic patients had less D1L than non-cirrhotic patients [66.3% (67/101 vs. 82.4% (402/488); p < 0.001]. FIB-4, APRI and Forns’ index were significantly lower (p < 0.001) in patients with D1L. Significant fibrosis was related to less D1L [74.3% (205/276) vs. 84.5% (284/336); p < 0.005]. Development of the prognostic tool (“Optim”) to predict D1L
In multivariate analyses, variables associated with D1L were: LVL [OR: 1.88 (95%CI: 1.04–3.38); p = 0.035], HIV co-infection [OR: 0.49 (95%CI: 0.27–0.88); p = 0.016], IL28B-CC [OR: 8.75 (95%CI: 3.78–20.25); p < 0.001], Genotype 1 [OR: 1.93 (95%CI: 0.99–3.74); p = 0.05], Forns’ Index [OR: 0.73 (95%CI: 0.62–0.85); p < 0.001] (Table 4). The AUROC was 0.81 (95%CI: 0.76–0.86; p < 0.0001) and the cut-off 0.733 showed a sensitivity of 78%, specificity of 65%, positive predictive value of 90% and negative predictive value of 42%. This model was confirmed in the validation cohort, except for the HCV genotype, with an AUROC of 0.71 (95%CI: 0.62–0.79); p < 0.001) (Fig 4) and a cut-off 0.733 showing a sensitivity of 82%, specificity of 46%, positive predictive value of 82% and negative predictive value of 37%. 10.1371/journal.pone.0122613.t004

Sensitivity of the model to predict SVR
SVR for RVR was 76.5% (101/132) and was 67% (146/218) for predicted RVR (p < 0.05). On the other hand, SVR for D1L was 51.7% (238/460) and was 54.3% (215/396) for predicted D1L (p > 0.05). Cost-analysis
Total cost for hepatitis C therapy per patient was estimated as €35,233 for the 48 weeks. The implementation of the proposed prognostic tool was associated with €10,665 saving/patient, in the base case scenario.
The total savings per patient in alternative scenarios ranged from €12,298 to €9,627 (Table 5). Assuming a fixed budget of €1,000,000, the implementation of the prognostic tool is to enable treatment of an additional 12 patients in the base case scenario. 10.1371/journal.pone.0122613.t005

€ -9,627 The combination of IL28B genotype with viral load, HCV-genotype, Forns’ Index (a non-invasive marker of fibrosis) and the presence of HIV co-infection enabled us to construct a tool able to predict virological response at week 4 in patients treated with peginterferon alfa-2a+ribavirin.In the course of boceprevir research & development for the treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype 1, a lead-in phase over 4 weeks was included in the design of the majority of clinical trials. Theoretically, this approach was to improve sustained virological response rate [15] and lower the rate of emergence of resistant variants. Despite both end-points not having been confirmed, the lead-in phase with P+R appeared to have helped a better classification for interferon sensitivity. Patients with RVR showed the same rate of SVR when treated with double or triple therapy, while patients without a decline of 1 log HCVRNA at week 4 did not achieve SVR despite receiving triple therapy. As reported by Marcellin et al [16] in a cohort of 558 patients with hepatitis C genotype 1, those with hepatitis C genotype 1 achieving RVR showed a rate of SVR >85%. In a sub-analysis of the SPRINT-1 study [14], patients without D1L achieved SVR rate of <15%. Thus, using the 4-week virological response could be very useful in making decisions in the management of hepatitis C genotype 1. Also, considerable cost saving could be made as well as adverse events being pre-empted in patients with little or no chance of achieving a cure in non-D1L, or in patients who do not require triple therapy because of having achieved RVR.The “Optim” tool, based on genetic, viral and host factors enabled us to predict treatment response at 4 weeks by mixing these 5 variables. Individualization of therapy appears to be crucial in improving the management of hepatitis C in clinical practice. Martinez-Bauer et al [17], combined baseline and week 4 virological response to predict SVR. Baseline viral load, AST/ALT ratio, serum cholesterol, and non-invasive estimation of liver fibrosis were included, together with RVR. Response was predicted accurately in approximately 60% of genotype 1 patients. A link between early viral dynamics and SVR has been well documented. In patients treated with P+R, the reduced SVR rates in patients >45 years of age, with severe liver fibrosis and high baseline viral load, were strongly associated with slower second phase decline of HCV-RNA [18]. These data were also confirmed in HIV/HCV co-infected patients [19]. Moreover, in a cohort of 113 HCV-genotype 1 patients, complete early virological response (cEVR) was the viral factor most strongly predictive of SVR in non-RVR patients [20]. Lastly, the combination of factors such as an evaluation of sequence of interferon-sensitivity-determining region (ISDR), T-helper 1/T-helper 2 ratio, body weight, and neutrophil count could predict SVR accurately at baseline [21]. Nevertheless, IL28B polymorphism needs to be added to this group of factors predicting virological response. Indeed, IL28B was found associated with RVR, EVR, ETR and SVR in treatment-naïve patients of HCV genotype 1 chronic infection [22], and was highlighted as the strongest factor predicting RVR in a large cohort of 1587 patients [23]. Thus, combining host and viral factors together with IL28B appears to build the most solid tool to predict D1L and RVR in patients undergoing P+R therapy. This observation at 4 weeks could preclude any further treatment over the standard scheduled 48 weeks. This tool would be freely available (http://www.optimtool.com/formula.html) for decision making regarding hepatitis C treatment and could confidently predict achieving D1L and RVR in patients with hepatitis C genotypes 1&4. This is possible irrespective of co-infection by HIV, or measurement of viral load, or the non-invasive estimation of fibrosis using the Forns’ Index. Although our study was designed to develop this tool in treatment-naïve patients, a similar approach could be explored in patients with previous treatment failure. Indeed, the Realize study demonstrated that, in the lead-in phase arm, SVR rate was lower in previously-treated non-responders without D1L. This supports the concept that, in these patients with functional mono-therapy, triple therapy should not be initiated since it is doomed to be ineffective or superfluous. The implementation of our predictive tool of viral response at week 4 could be useful in the assessment of those potential candidates for antiviral treatment (Fig 5). It enables the identification of a subgroup of patients having a low probability of achieving a reduction of HCV-RNA <1 log after 4 weeks of combination therapy (lead-in) and, in whom, the probability of SVR to triple therapy is suboptimal. It could be argued that, in these patients, the benefit of boceprevir- or telaprevir-based triple therapy is limited and, as such, it would be reasonable to await the advent of more effective agents that would pre-empt adverse events and allow a reallocation of available resources to those patients who have an increased likelihood of achieving SVR. In addition, this predictive tool could identify patients having a high probability of response to P+R (those with a high probability of achieving RVR) in whom dual or triple therapies are equally effective and, as such, the protease inhibitor may be best reserved for second-line therapeutic use. Further, this tool may help ensure that resources are used in an efficient manner since it would result, in a base-case scenario, in a reduction of 29.6% in the budget.

Fig 5 The decision tree based on sensitivity of the proposed prognostic tool to predict RVR and D1L. The results of the study may be particularly useful in determining when triple therapy could be the most efficient approach. It could be helpful, as well, in determining whether the therapy should even be initiated. Although the addition of telaprevir to P+R has clearly improved SVR rate for HCV genotype 1, adverse events and costs have emerged as relevant barriers for generalized use around the world. The median total cost for 48 weeks of protease inhibitor-based triple therapy was higher, including direct and indirect costs [24]. However, this cost analysis rests on the assumption that patients will be willing to be treated with dual therapy and, in some cases with a low probability of achieving D1L, to await new therapeutic developments. In spite of the recent approval of the new direct acting antivirals, therapy based on peginterferon and ribavirin will keep playing an important role in particular scenarios. In the most cost-sensitive countries, the reported tool could help to distinguish those patients for dual or triple therapy and, consequently, optimize the resources. The aim of the proposed strategy is to maximize benefits from the National Health Service (NHS) viewpoint since an NHS is charged with providing the greatest health-care benefits within the available resources. In this context, it is unclear how patients will respond to options that may not fulfill their therapeutic expectations.Our cost-analysis has several limitations: a) we did not considered either response-guided therapy or futility rules of triple therapy in our model. This was because of lack of individual data regarding the relevance of D1L in short treatment regimens in the pivotal studies of boceprevir- and telaprevir-based treatments [25,26]. This approach may overestimate the cost savings in non-cirrhotic patients; b) since the treatment costs of the 2 protease inhibitors differ in different countries, we assumed an average cost of a general protease inhibitor treatment for 48 weeks. In assessing the consistency of the estimations made on the base case, alternative scenarios were tested and showed similar results. Our findings in the present study are limited to previously-untreated patients and should be interpreted only in the context of this population.In conclusion, the combination of genetic (IL28B polymorphism) and viral genotype together with viral load, HIV co-infection and fibrosis stage defined a tool to predict RVR and D1L at week 4. The implementation of this tool in clinical practice could be a cost-saving strategy, compared to the universal triple therapy for hepatitis C. As such, it could contribute to a more efficient allocation of limited resources."
