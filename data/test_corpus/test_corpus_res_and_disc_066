"Among the 169 patients with biopsy-proven HCV-related cirrhosis, the baseline demographic and clinical data according to EGF, IL28B, and PNPLA3 genotypes are shown in Table 1. The mean age of the cohort was 50±9 years. The cohort was predominantly Caucasian (84%), male (74%) and had Child-Pugh Class A (93%) or Class B (7%) cirrhosis. After a median follow-up of 6.6 years (IQR: 4.7–9.2 years), 66 (39%) patients developed at least one episode of clinical deterioration. Outcomes included death related to portopulmonary hypertension, n = 1; ascites, n = 18; variceal hemorrhage, n = 13; HE n = 7; HCC, n = 18; ascites and HE, n = 7; variceal hemorrhage and HE, n = 1; and ascites and variceal hemorrhage, n = 1.10.1371/journal.pone.0114747.t001Table 1

Compared with AA genotype, EGF non-AA genotype was associated with an age, sex, and race-adjusted HR of 3.20 (95% CI 1.57–6.52; p = 0.001) for clinical deterioration. Compared with CC genotype, IL28B non-CC genotype was associated with an age, sex, and race-adjusted HR of 1.78 (95%CI 1.03–3.06; p = 0.04) for clinical deterioration. Compared with CC genotype, PNPLA3 non-CC genotype was associated with an age, sex, race-adjusted HR of 1.79 (95%CI 1.10–2.90; p = 0.02) for clinical deterioration.10.1371/journal.pone.0114747.g002Figure 2

We performed a sensitivity analysis limiting the outcome to the time to development of ascites, variceal hemorrhage, or HE. EGF non-AA genotype remained a significant predictor of increased risk of clinical deterioration (age, sex, race-adjusted HR = 2.93; 95%CI 1.30–6.60; p = 0.01). The association between PNPLA3 genotype and clinical deterioration also persisted (age, sex, race-adjusted HR = 1.93; 95%CI 1.10–3.37; p = 0.02 for non-CC compared to CC). However, the association between IL28B genotype and clinical deterioration was no longer significant (age, sex, race-adjusted HR = 1.52; 95%CI 0.83–2.79; p = 0.18 for non-CC compared to CC). We also conducted analyses restricted to those with Child-Pugh Class A cirrhosis, and found that EGF non-AA genotype was associated with the risk of clinical deterioration in Child-Pugh Class A subjects (age, sex, race-adjusted HR = 3.30; 95%CI 1.46–7.35; p = 0.004). The significant association between PNPLA3 genotype and risk of clinical deterioration also persisted (age, sex, race-adjusted HR = 2.04; 95%CI 1.16–3.60; p = 0.01 for non-CC compared with CC). The association between IL28B genotype and risk of clinical deterioration did not remain statistically significant (age, sex, race-adjusted HR = 1.81; 95%CI 0.95–3.48; p = 0.07 for non-CC compared with CC).One hundred twenty-six patients (75%) received some course of antiviral therapy with either interferon alfa alone or interferon alfa and ribavirin following the index biopsy. Among these, forty patients (32%) achieved a SVR to antiviral therapy. Among these forty patients, only 3 patients developed clinical deterioration. One patient had an episode of variceal hemorrhage and two patients developed HCC. When we incorporated achievement of SVR into the age, sex, and race-adjusted model, EGF non-AA genotype remained a significant predictor of increased risk of clinical deterioration (HR = 2.74; 95%CI 1.32–5.67; p = 0.007). There were no longer significant associations between IL28B genotype (age, sex, race-adjusted HR 1.61; 95%CI 0.93–2.79; p = 0.09 for non-CC compared with CC) and PNPLA3 genotype (age, sex, and race-adjusted HR 1.56; 95%CI 0.96–2.56; p = 0.07 for non-CC compared with CC) and clinical deterioration. The addition of SVR to the age, sex, and race-adjusted model with all 3 loci did not materially alter the results.We found significant associations between EGF, IL28B, and PNPLA3 genotypes and the risk of clinical deterioration in patients with HCV-related cirrhosis. The risk associated with EGF genotype persisted, even after adjustment for known clinical predictors of progression, including albumin, bilirubin, and platelets. These results suggest that genetic variation at the EGF locus is independently associated with clinical deterioration in patients with CHC and provides prognostic information beyond known clinical predictors. In contrast, genetic variations at IL28B and PNPLA3 loci were associated with prognosis in age, sex, and race-adjusted models, but the association was no longer statistically significant after adjustment for albumin, bilirubin, and platelets. This may reflect either a weaker association of these polymorphisms with clinical deterioration compared with the EGF polymorphism or the possibility that the effect of the IL28B and PNPLA3 polymorphisms on clinical deterioration may be mediated by these clinical factors. Thus, controlling for these variables may mask a true biological relation. Our combined analysis shows that the risk of clinical deterioration significantly increases with the presence of each unfavorable genotype and suggests that all three SNPs in concert could be useful in predicting disease progression.Our findings are consistent with prior data regarding the EGF locus and clinical outcome in liver disease. We previously found that the EGF AG and GG genotypes are associated with a two to four-fold increased risk for HCC [10]. Moreover, EGF expression, as assessed in a gene expression signature in non-tumoral liver tissue, is associated with poor survival in HCC patients after resection and with progression to advanced cirrhosis, HCC development and poor survival in HCV-related early-stage cirrhosis [20], [21]. Our findings extend the results of these studies by identifying a role for the EGF locus independently or in concert with two additional SNPs in not only the development of HCC but also the progression of HCV-related cirrhosis. Consistent with these results is a cross-sectional study showing that the G allele of EGF rs4444903 is associated with higher degrees of liver fibrosis in younger subjects with CHC [12].Our results are consistent with the functional nature of EGF rs4444903. We have previously reported increased stability of EGF 61*G allele transcripts compared to EGF 61*A allele transcripts in human hepatoma cell lines and primary human hepatocytes as well as increased levels of serum and liver EGF in subjects with cirrhosis who have the EGF GG versus AA genotype [10]. Additionally, the EGF receptor (EGFR) [22] and its HRas signaling pathway have been identified as host factors for HCV cellular entry [23]. HCV infection also induces EGFR signaling in cell culture models [24] and increases EGFR expression in HCV-infected patients [23]. Taken together with our study, these findings support a key role for EGF in the mediation of CHC-related liver damage.Our finding of an association between increased risk of clinical deterioration and the IL28B non-CC genotype in age, sex, and race-adjusted analysis is supported by evidence that carriage of the T allele is associated with fibrosis severity, cirrhosis and HCC in CHC [7], [9]. In contrast to our results, however, one group showed that the CC genotype was associated with increased risk for adverse clinical outcomes [8]. This group also found no association between IL28B genotype and fibrosis progression. The difference in our findings may be related to the fact that their cohort consisted of patients who were prior non-responders to interferon and ribavirin and had advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis. Of note, the association between IL28B genotype and clinical deterioration was not significant in our analysis when restricted to Child Pugh Class A subjects or after excluding HCC from the definition of the primary outcome. This may reflect limited power in this smaller cohort and potentially a more limited role for the IL28B genotype in hepatic decompensation compared with development of HCC. The association between IL28B genotype and clinical deterioration was also no longer significant after adjustment for SVR. This likely reflects the fact that the impact of IL28B on clinical deterioration is mediated through response to therapy or potentially limited power to detect the association in the larger model.Our results showing an association between PNPLA3 non-CC genotype and risk of clinical deterioration in age, sex, and race-adjusted analysis is supported by a study showing an association between the PNPLA3 C>G polymorphism and fibrosis progression in CHC [14] and a meta-analysis showing an association between this polymorphism and hepatocarcinogenesis in subjects of European descent [16].Our study has several limitations. First, we excluded sixteen subjects from the multivariable model adjusting for known predictors of disease progression due to missing laboratory variables. This may have limited our power to detect the association between the PNPLA3 and IL28B polymorphisms and clinical deterioration in analyses adjusted for established laboratory predictors of outcome. Second, we did not have information on disease duration prior to the biopsy. However, no patients had evidence of decompensated liver disease prior to the biopsy and our results were consistent even among those with Child-Pugh Class A disease. Third, because the index biopsies were performed between 1990 and 2007, we did not have reliable information quantifying the amount of steatosis on each biopsy, and thus could not incorporate this into our multivariable model. While steatosis has been shown to predict fibrosis progression prior to the development of cirrhosis, it has not been shown to predict decompensation once cirrhosis has occurred. Fourth, our population was predominantly Caucasian males, limiting the external generalizability of our findings. However, recent meta-analyses revealed that although allele frequencies of the EGF polymorphism vary according to race, the association between EGF genotype and HCC risk appears independent of race [25], [26]. Nonetheless, further studies are required to validate our findings in more diverse cohorts. Last, we only examined clinical deterioration among individuals with hepatitis C-related cirrhosis. It is unknown if our findings would be similar among patients with other etiologies of cirrhosis. However, a recent study reported an association between carriage of the EGF G allele and cirrhosis in 62 subjects with chronic HBV infection [27].In conclusion, our findings support a role for EGF and possibly IL28B and PNPLA3 genotyping in identifying persons with CHC at high risk for disease progression. In light of our group's finding that pharmacological inhibition of EGFR with erlotinib prevented progression of cirrhosis and regressed fibrosis in animal models of progressive cirrhosis [28], EGFR inhibition may be a promising therapeutic approach for reduction of fibrogenesis and prevention of HCC in high risk patients. Taken together with the known association of genetic variation in the EGF gene with EGF levels, our data support the potential for EGF genotyping to identify patients who may be candidates for strategies to modulate EGF."
