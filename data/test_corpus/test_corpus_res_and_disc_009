"A strong association was noted between the distribution of HCV genotypes and IL28B SNP variants (P<0.0001 for rs12979860 and rs12980275, and P = 0.01 for rs8099917, Chi squared test; Table 1) with the favorable CC at rs12979860, AA at rs12980275, and TT at rs8099917 being significantly more common in patients with HCV genotype 2 or 3 infection than genotype 1 (Figure 1). The 11 patients infected with HCV genotype 4 had a similar distribution of IL28B variants as patients infected with genotype 1. Patients who were homozygous for the favorable SNP genotypes had higher baseline viral load (mean 6.3 log10 IU/mL; Table 1); heterozygous patients had intermediate (mean 6.1 log10 IU/mL for rs12979860 and rs12980275, and 5.9 log10 IU/mL for TG at rs8099917); and patients who were homozygous for the risk alleles had lower (mean 5.9 log10 IU/mL for TT at rs12979860, 6.0 log10 IU/mL for GG at rs12980275, and 5.8 log10 IU/mL for GG at rs8099917, P = 0.0013, P = 0.029, and P = 0.0004 respectively; Table 1). 10.1371/journal.pone.0017232.g001 Figure 1 Frequency distribution of IL28B variants in relation to HCV genotypes 1-3. Significantly lower baseline plasma IP-10 levels were observed in homozygous carriers of the favorable CC at rs12979860 (median 189 vs. 258 pg/mL, P = 0.02, Mann-Whitney U-test; Figure 2), AA at rs12980275 (median 189 vs. 258 pg/mL, P = 0.01), and TT at rs8099917 (median 224 vs. 288 pg/mL, P = 0.04), as compared with patients carrying one or two copies of the risk alleles. 10.1371/journal.pone.0017232.g002 Figure 2 Tenth, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 90th percentiles of pretreatment IP-10 in relation to IL28B variants. Among genotype 1 infected patients, homozygous carriers of the three favorable IL28B alleles had significantly more pronounced first phase viral decline, as reflected by the reduction of HCV RNA from treatment day 0 to 4, when compared with patients carrying the risk alleles (mean 2.0, 0.9 and 0.6 log10 IU/mL for rs12979860 CC, CT and TT, 1.8, 0.9 and 0.7 log10 IU/mL for rs12980275 AA, AG and TT, and 1.4, 0.8 and 0.6 for rs8099917 TT, TG and GG respectively, P<0.0001 for all 3 SNPs; Kruskal-Wallis test). Among homozygous or heterozygous carriers of the favorable alleles, IP-10 was highly significantly associated with the first phase reduction of HCV RNA (rs = −0.50, P = 0.001 and rs = −0.40, P<0.0001 for rs12979860 CC and CT, rs = −0.29, P = 0.04 and rs = −0.39, P = 0.0003 for rs12980275 AA and AG, and rs = −0.40, P<0.0001 and rs = −0.25, P = 0.046 for rs8099917 TT and TG respectively; Figure 3). This association was also significant for the maximum decline in HCV RNA from day 0 to 4 as well as the decline from day 0 to 1, thus emphasizing an association with the first phase decline in HCV RNA, and translated into a more rapid reduction of HCV RNA during the first 4 weeks of therapy among patients with lower baseline IP-10, and a slower decline among those with higher (Figure 4). Similarly, among genotype 2/3 infected patients, CC carriers of rs12979860 had significantly more pronounced first phase viral decline, as reflected by the reduction of HCV RNA from treatment day 0 to 4, when compared with patients carrying the risk allele (mean 2.7, 2.1 and 1.6 log10 IU/mL for CC, CT and TT, P = 0.04; Kruskal-Wallis test) and IP-10 was significantly correlated with the reduction in HCV RNA from day 0 to 4 in the 22 HCV genotype 2/3 infected patients with rs12979860 CT (rs = −0.45, P = 0.04). In contrast to the first phase reduction in HCV RNA, none of the IL28B-related SNPs or baseline IP-10 predicted the second phase decline after stratification for the first phase decline. 10.1371/journal.pone.0017232.g003 Figure 3 Correlation between IP-10 and first phase decline in IL28B variants among HCV genotype 1 patients. 10.1371/journal.pone.0017232.g004 Figure 4 Mean HCV RNA reduction according to IP-10 in HCV genotype 1 with favorable IL28B genotype. Both rs12979860 (P = 0.006) and rs12980275 (P = 0.007) were significantly predictive of RVR, i.e. undetectable HCV RNA at week 4, whereas the allelic distribution of rs8099917 was not (P = 0.18). Similarly, baseline plasma IP-10 was lower in patients achieving RVR than in those who did not (median 222 pg/mL vs. 401 pg/mL, P = 0.008; Mann-Whitney U-test), and, among homozygous carriers of the rs12979860 and rs8099917 alleles, a lower baseline IP-10 significantly predicted RVR (Table 2). Interestingly none of the patients with baseline IP-10 above 600 pg/mL achieved RVR regardless of IL28B genotype.10.1371/journal.pone.0017232.t002Table 2 The impact of IL28B genetic variations and baseline plasma IP-10 on the likelihood of achieving RVR among patients infected with HCV genotype 1.

The distribution of variants at SNP rs12979860 and rs12980275 impacted significantly on SVR among HCV genotype 1 infected patients (66% vs. 48% for rs12979860 CC and CT/TT, P = 0.04; 65% vs. 47% for rs12980275 AA and AG/GG, P = 0.03; Chi squared test), but not among variants of rs8099917, although a non-significant trend towards lower SVR was noted among the 7 homozygous GG carriers as compared to 162 carriers of TT or TG (29% vs. 54%, P = 0.2). Again, IP-10 significantly augmented the prediction of SVR among genotype 1 infected for all three IL28B SNPs with the exception of G allele carriage at rs8099917 (Figure 5). In patients with baseline IP-10 below 150 pg/mL who were homozygous for favorable SNP genotypes, SVR was achieved in 85%, 75%, and 75% for rs12979860 CC, rs12980275 AA, and rs8099917 TT, respectively. Notably, achieving RVR was slightly more predictive of achieving SVR (91%; Table 3) than combinations of IL28B and baseline IP-10. This remained the case even when the analysis was restricted to the genotype 1 infected patients who had no dose reductions, i.e. per-protocol analysis (92% vs. 83% for RVR and rs12979860 CC and baseline IP-10 below 150 pg/mL respectively; n = 126). In contrast to genotype 1, neither IL28B genotype distribution nor baseline IP-10 levels predicted SVR among the 71 HCV genotype 2/3 infected patients. 10.1371/journal.pone.0017232.g005 Figure 5 SVR rates in HCV genotype 1 according to IL28B variants and baseline IP-10. 10.1371/journal.pone.0017232.t003Table 3 Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of the likelihood achieving SVR among patients infected with HCV genotype 1 (n = 170).

RVR remained the only predictor of SVR when the analysis was restricted to the fully compliant patients (P = 0.005) reiterating the importance of monitoring on-treatment response.In spite of the pending introduction of direct antiviral agents (DAA) in routine clinical practice, interferon-α and ribavirin are likely to retain pivotal roles in the management of chronic HCV infection, and thus predicting responsiveness to interferon/ribavirin-based therapies will remain important. In this setting, the main finding in the present study was that pretreatment plasma levels of IP-10 increased the level of prediction of the first phase decline in HCV RNA among patients carrying IL28B SNP variants, which translated into improved prediction of RVR and SVR. Considering the high SVR rates among HCV genotype 1 infected homozygous carriers of CC at rs12979860, AA at rs12980275, or TT at rs8099917 with baseline IP-10 levels below 150 pg/mL (85%, 76%, and 75% respectively), these patients, although few in number, should be encouraged to initiate therapy and may be candidates for shortened duration of therapy in line with current treatment guidelines considering the high likelihood of achieving RVR [24], [25]. Additionally, these patients may be suitable for initial inclusion in pending trials with interferon-free DAA regimes, because of the favorable odds of successful salvage therapy with interferon in the event of development of resistance towards these new therapeutic agents.The finding that IL28B variants primarily impact on the first phase decline of HCV RNA [26], as previously reported for IP-10 [20], suggests that both IL28B variants and IP-10 are linked to the antiviral effectiveness of peg-IFN and ribavirin in the blocking of the production or release of infectious virions rather than on the clearance of HCV infected cells. The risk alleles, T at rs12979860, or G at rs12980275 and rs8099917, were found to be significantly associated with modest elevations of baseline IP-10 levels. This finding is in line with the recent report by Honda et al. that G at rs8099917 entails higher intrahepatic expression of a panel of 37 representative ISGs not including IP-10 [13], which is typically observed in patients who respond less favorably to treatment [27]. The elevated baseline induction of ISGs among risk allele carriers may explain why these alleles are associated with a lower viral load observed in our study among patients with chronic HCV infection, corroborating previous reports [8], [11].Our finding that homozygous CC at rs12979860, AA at rs12980275, and TT at rs8099917 were significantly more common in the setting of HCV genotype 2 or 3 infection than 1 in a population consisting only of Caucasian patients confirms and extends the findings reported by McCarthy et al. [11]. Indeed, the proportion of CC at rs12979860 among HCV genotype 2 and 3 infected patients (56% and 67%, respectively) in our study is higher than the reported prevalence in HCV uninfected Caucasians (∼40%), suggesting that this SNP genotype entails a higher likelihood of development of chronic infection following exposure to HCV genotype 2 or 3. This observation, however, may be considered counter-intuitive since homozygous carriage of CC at rs12979860 was associated with a significantly greater first phase decline of HCV RNA even in genotype 2/3 infected patients. A possible hypothesis for these seemingly contradictory findings is that carriage of the favorable allele C at rs12979860, A at rs12980275 and T at rs8099917, being associated with a slightly diminished baseline activation of ISGs, is beneficial for clearance of all HCV genotypes as reflected by the association with a greater first phase decline in HCV RNA during therapy irrespective of HCV genotype, but more advantageous for genotype 1 in comparison to 2/3. In the event of continuous re-exposure to a variety of HCV genotypes following a possible initial spontaneous clearance of HCV, as is often the case among intravenous drug users in addition to the lack of a lasting protective immune response [28], this skewness will exert selective pressure and over time lead to an under-representation of these favorable alleles among genotype 1 patients and an over-representation among 2/3 patients as compared to the non-infected population. This would be the case even if carriage of this SNP genotype were slightly beneficial in the event of a single point exposure to HCV genotype 2 or 3. Supportive of this concept is the non-significant trend towards lower frequency of homozygous CC at rs12979860 (30%) observed among 27 HCV genotype 2/3 patients infected through exposure to contaminated blood products as compared to 322 genotype 2/3 patients with other routes of infection in another study (NORDynamIC trial) [29]. Similarly, in an elderly population in southern Italy predominantly infected with HCV genotype 2 likely secondary to past iatrogenic exposure, a non-significant trend towards a lower proportion of CC at rs12979860 was noted among genotype 2/3 infected patients than among non-infected controls (37% vs. 42%) [30].In conclusion, baseline plasma IP-10 is significantly associated with IL28B-related SNPs, and augments the level of predictiveness of the first phase decline in HCV RNA, RVR, and final treatment outcome. Therefore, pre-treatment screening of IL28B genetic variants, together with measurement of IP-10 in plasma, may provide useful prognostic information prior to initiating antiviral therapy for HCV."
