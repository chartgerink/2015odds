"IL28B Genotype and HCV Viral Clearance We had previously shown that the IL28B rs8099917 G allele predicts failure to clear HCV on PegIFN/R therapy [5], in the CHC cohort now analysed here for HLA-C and KIR genotypes. Carriers of the G allele were under-represented in SC (odds ratio [OR] 0.26, p = 1.71×10−14, 2.67–5.48) (Tables 2 and S1). The G allele appears to have a dominant effect, with both heterozygotes (OR 3.42, p = 1.32×10−11, 2.36–4.96) and homozygotes (OR 3.25, p = 1.78×10−2, 1.16–9.10) being similarly more likely to fail to clear virus spontaneously. SNP rs8099917 G carriers were 19.7% of SC, 27.5% of healthy controls (HapMap CEU [Utah residents with Northern or Western European ancestry] data), 37.9% of SVR, and 57.3% of NSVR (Table S1). Overall, those who failed to clear the virus after therapy or without therapy (NSVR versus SVR and SC) were much less likely to have the rs8099917 TT genotype (OR 0.34, p = 1.44×10−17) (Table S1), with both heterozygotes (OR 2.59, p = 5.91×10−14) and homozygotes (OR 2.12, p = 7.54×10−3) for the G allele more likely to fail to clear virus. 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001092.t002Table 2 Association of IL28B rs8099917 and HLA-C genotypes with viral clearance on therapy and spontaneous clearance.

C1*, C1 carriers; G*, G carriers. Comparisons with p<0.05 are in bold. a Table S2 shows the data for all genotypes. b Three different n represent the three sets of genotyping results being compared in this table, respectively. HLA-C2C2 Predicts Poor Viral Clearance on Therapy The HLA-C1 and C2 variants are associated with a number of aspects of viral clearance. HLA-C2 homozygotes were more likely to fail to clear virus on therapy than other genotypes (OR 1.52, p = 0.025, 1.05–2.20) (Figure 1; Table 2). The HLA-C effect on viral clearance seems to be a recessive trait, such that C1 heterozygotes are no more susceptible to treatment failure than C1 homozygotes. HLA-C2 homozygosity was not different between those participants with spontaneous virus clearance and healthy European controls (data for healthy controls from [22],[23]) (see Table S2). This important observation suggests that the difference in association of HLA-C genotype with viral clearance is due to response to therapy alone, not to the immune response in the absence of therapy. From two-digit genotyping of HLA-C, the C2 variant conferring highest susceptibility to treatment failure is Cw*05 (OR 1.43, p = 0.047, 1.0–2.03) (Table S3). The Cw*03 variant of C1 confers significant drug response (OR 0.61, p = 1.64×10−3, 0.44–0.83). 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001092.g001 Figure 1 Association of HLA-C genotype with viral clearance with and without therapy.

Vertical height of plotted points is in proportion to log (1/p) where “p” is the probability of observed association being by chance. ORs are shown for each comparison. G*, carrier of G allele. Effect of KIR Genes on Viral Clearance We tested if KIR2DL2 or 2DL3 affected response to therapy, protection against development of CHC, or clearance of virus with or without PegIFN/R (Table S4). As reported by others [13],[14], we observed no effect of KIR genotype per se on viral clearance in any comparison. There was evidence of a similar trend between homozygosity of HLA-C1 and KIR2DL3 with SVR [14], and with spontaneous clearance [13]. Consistent with Knapp et al. [14] and Khakoo et al. [13], we found evidence that those infected with HCV and with the KIR2DL3/C2C2 genotype, were more likely to fail to clear virus (OR 1.91, p = 0.022, 1.09–3.36) (Table S5) on therapy (NSVR versus SVR), and more common in those who failed to clear virus on therapy (NSVR) compared to those who did combined with those who cleared HCV without therapy (SVR+SC) (OR 2.08, p = 3.00×10−3, 1.27–3.40). We next tested the combination of HLA-C alleles with KIR2DL3 and 2DL2 genes (Table S6). There was evidence of increased association with the complementary pairs, so that the combination of the C1 variant Cw*03 with its inhibiting genes was associated with increased treatment response: Cw*03 alone OR is 0.61 (p = 1.64×10−3, 0.44–0.83), with 2DL2 is 0.47 (p = 1.19×10−3, 0.29–0.75), with 2DL3 is 0.49 (p = 2.13×10−4, 0.33–0.72). Most of the C2 association with treatment failure was due to allele Cw*05 (OR 1.43, p = 4.66×10−2, 1.0–2.03), with a larger effect in combination with the inactivating haplotype tagged by 2DL3 (OR 1.97, p = 2.04×10−3, 1.28–3.06), but unaffected by 2DL2. Effect of Activating KIR Genes on Viral Clearance The KIR ligands on NK cells activated on ligation to HLA-C are KIR2DS2 for HLA-C1, and KIR2DS1 for HLA-C2. Increased activation could occur in HLA-C1 carriers who are also carriers of KIR2DS2, and for HLA-C2 carriers who are also carriers of KIR2DS1. However, we found no evidence that KIR2DS genotypes affected viral clearance either singly or in combination with HLA-C genotypes (Tables S7 and S8), although from a logistic regression model, it seems that KIR2DS1 could mitigate the effect of HLA-C2C2 (see below). Combined Effect of HLA-C and IL28B Genotypes Prediction of failure to clear HCV in response to treatment with either IL28B or HLA-C genotypes alone is of limited value clinically due to the relatively low positive predictive value (PPV) for treatment failure [24]. We therefore tested if both genotypes together provided additional power to predict response. Indeed, the combination significantly improves prediction of failure to clear virus on therapy (OR 3.78, p = 8.83×10−6, 2.03–7.04), failure to clear virus spontaneously (OR 7.31, p = 1.27×10−3, 1.78–30.06), and failure to clear virus with and without therapy (OR 5.10, p = 2.53×10−9, 2.84–9.17) (Tables 2 and S9a). The largest difference was between those participants with spontaneous virus clearance and those who failed to clear virus on therapy (Figure 2). As shown in Table 3, prediction of treatment failure improved from 66% for IL28B G to 80% with IL28B G*/C2C2. 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001092.g002 Figure 2 Proportion of each cohort with the HLA-C2C2 and IL28B G* genotype, which predicts treatment failure.

A similar predictive value for treatment response has been reported for IL28B SNP rs12979860[4] We found that the PPV derived from combining this SNP and HLA-C2C2 was actually lower in this cohort than for the rs8099917 combination (OR 2.52, p = 5.18×10−5, 1.59–3.98) (Table S9b). Adding the clinical features of age, gender, body mass index, or viral load improved predictive value (Figure S1, responder operator curves). Interactions between IL28B, HLA-C, and KIR Using a logistic regression model, the increased OR of 3.78 for the combination rs8099917, G*/C2C2 is partially due to genetic interaction (LR, p<0.05) (Table S10), and not just an additive effect. Examining the relationship between KIR genotype and either HLA-C2C2 or IL28B rs8099917 G*, we found no evidence for any two-way interactions for predicting failure of SVR. For the three-way interaction model between HLA-C, IL28, and not 2DS1, although the coefficient for the three-way interaction is significant, the LR test concludes that the model does not produce a significantly better fit (LR, p = 0.28). Although the HLA-C main effect is not significant via a standard t-test in the interaction model, it is associated with response (Table 2). Adding HLA-C to a model including rs8099917 leads to significant improvement of the fit (LR, p = 0.006), implying that HLA-C has an independent affect on response and should be included in the model. Adding the interaction term again improves the model fit (LR, p = 0.03). The IL28B genotype is already used to predict treatment response to PegIFN/R in clinical practice, even though its association with therapeutic response was only first identified in late 2009. We tested the IL28B, HLA-C, and KIR gene variant associations with treatment-induced and spontaneous clearance of HCV and confirmed that IL28B rs8099917 predicts clearance in both situations. The HLA-C2C2 genotype predicted failure to clear HCV on treatment, but no association with failure to clear HCV without treatment was detected. The prediction of treatment-induced clearance was additive and interactive between IL28B and HLA-C; and there was evidence of additive and interactive effects between KIR2DL3, KIR2DS1, and HLA-C2C2. These data and previous reports point to HLA-C as being the second gene predicting PegIFN/R treatment response in HCV. This genetic evidence supports an underlying physiological mechanism for HCV viral control involving an interaction between IL28B, HLA-C, and KIRs.Khakoo et al. [13] and Dring et al. [25] compared HLA-C and KIR genotypes between those participants with spontaneous virus clearance and CHC, and Knapp et al. [14] in these and in treatment response. As in our study, Khakoo et al. reported HLA-C2 homozygotes were more common in CHC than SC (OR 1.49, p = 0.02), and KIR2DL3-C2 homozygotes slightly more so (OR 1.87, p = 0.01); and Dring et al. reported KIR2DS3-C2 carriers were more common in CHC than SC (OR 2.26, p = 0.002). Knapp et al. detected a trend towards C2 excess in those who failed to clear virus spontaneously compared to CHC (OR 1.69, p = 0.10), a trend of C2 excess in NSVR versus SVR (OR 1.38, p = 0.27) [13], but no difference between SVR and SC. In both the Knapp study and ours, the KIR2DL3-C1 homozygotes were more common in SVR, and most of this association was due to the C1-Cw*03 variant. KIR2DL3 tags haplotype A, which contains fewer activating KIR genes. This association is consistent with insufficient activation of NK cells in the context of HLA-C2C2 inhibition as the basis for increased risk of treatment failure.Dring et al. [25] identified a dramatic synergy between KIR2DS3 (not examined here, encoded on haplotype B) and the IL28B SNP rs12979860 in predicting spontaneous clearance in a unusually homogenous cohort of Irish females infected with genotype 1 HCV by transfusion. They also showed that IFNλ inhibited IFNγ production by NK cells. They did not examine SNP rs8099917 or SVR and NSVR. Their data further support NK function in HCV clearance as being influenced by IFNλ.Because of the very high linkage disequilibrium in the MHC class I region around HLA-C, the association we and others have observed may be due to HLA-C variants tagging other class I genes. However, the KIR interactions, which are HLA-C specific, support the signal being due to HLA-C itself, as does the strong body of evidence pointing to the importance of NK cells in killing virally infected cells in response to interferon and tumor necrosis factor-alpha-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) (reviewed in [26]–[28]). In addition, activated NK cells recognize and lyse HCV replicon-containing hepatoma cells in vitro [27] and should therefore be able to kill virus-infected hepatocytes in vivo. Cells that lack or have downregulated MHC class I molecules, such as virally infected cells or tumour cells, are susceptible to NK cell-mediated killing. In this context it has been reported that IFNλ3 (the protein encoded by IL28B) augments the antitumor activity of NK cells [11],[27].The association of HLA-C with viral clearance on treatment but not spontaneous clearance suggests that, on therapy, NK killing of hepatocytes is augmented in HLA-C1 carriers compared to C2 homozygotes. There are numerous potential mechanisms by which HLA-C genotypes could affect NK cell activity in the context of IFNα treatment. IFNα could affect NK killing of HCV-infected hepatocytes. IFNα is known to increase NK sensitivity to activation [27], but also to directly activate NK cells in patients with HCV infection and induced a strongly cytotoxic phenotype [27]. This NK cell activation and killing of hepatocytes is affected by the HLA-C genotype: the C1 allele allowing activation more rapidly and aggressively [16]. HLA-C may be even more upregulated in response to IFNα [29], making it more difficult for C2 homozygotes to activate NK cells.The association of IL28B genotype with SC and therapeutic response indicates that IFNλ3 affects viral clearance. IFNλ3 is likely to enhance antiviral mechanisms through upregulation of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in acute disease [24], but its effect may be more complicated in chronic infection, in which upregulation of ISGs in liver is associated with reduced treatment response [30]. One approach to identifying the molecular pathways through which a genetic variant affects disease outcome is to identify other genes that affect pathogenesis, and especially those with which it may interact. The additive association of HLA-C and IL28B genotypes with treatment-induced clearance, but not spontaneous clearance, suggests IL28B may be enhancing NK killing on PegIFN/R therapy. HLA-C is one of the most upregulated genes following treatment of a cell line with IFNλ3 [29]. The degree of this upregulation may depend on HLA-C genotype.The larger predictive value for HLA-C2C2 and IL28B rs8099917 G* than SNP rs12979860 T* may indicate different haplotype effects. There are five common IL28B haplotypes in Caucasians [5]. The rs8099917 minor allele tags the haplotype with the highest association with therapeutic response, whilst rs12979860 minor alleles are on this haplotype and others (Table S11). Ge et al. [4] reported that there was evidence of independent effects of the two haplotypes. Therefore the additive effect of HLA-C with IL28B may be only with the rs8099917-tagged haplotype. It is likely that these two SNPs, which were on genotyping chips, will be supplanted by others when a more comprehensive analysis of the genetic variation of IL28B is available.The overall differences in frequency of HLA-C2C2/IL28B G* in healthy controls, those participants with spontaneous virus clearance, SVR, and NSVR groups suggests a role in pathogenesis for this gene combination. It is also striking that HLA-C2C2 frequency is highly variable between ethnic groups, roughly in proportion to their treatment responsiveness (Figure S2). Much of the variation between African Americans and European Americans has been explained by the IL28B rs12979860 SNP [4], but it seems likely that the higher proportion of the HLA-C2C2 genotype in African Americans may also contribute to their reduced viral clearance.With regard to patient management, avoiding treatment in those less likely to respond to PegIFN/R is important given the toxicity of this treatment and the likelihood that one or multiple direct acting antiviral agents will soon be available [31],[32]. In this context, IL28B genotype alone allows prediction of failure of PegIFN/R in only 66% of patients (Table 3). We have shown that with HLA-C genotyping this can be improved to a clinically more meaningful 80%. Genotyping of IL28B and HLA-C to C1/C2 is rapid and inexpensive. Further genetic associations, including those affecting HLA-C/IFNλ interactions, viral sequence variability [33], and host/virus interactions such as IP-10 levels [34] might further enhance prediction of treatment outcomes.In addition to supporting the importance of HLA-C, KIR, and IL28B in HCV clearance and drug response, and emphasizing the role of NK cells in the outcomes of HCV infection, this study highlights the value of investigating variants other than SNPs to identify genetic variants causing disease and drug response. Notably, independent replication of these data in Europeans, and testing them for the first time in African-Americans and other ethnic groups is required."
