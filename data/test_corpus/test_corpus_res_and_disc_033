"The polymorphism rs12979860 (IL28B) has been studied extensively  throughout the world. Several reports have described a strong association between the response to treatment and IL28B genotype [5,6,17,18]. Genotyping of IL28B SNPs provides valuable information about the possibility of the patient’s achieving a sustained virological response to treatment of chronic hepatitis C, which is increasingly important in clinical practice.Today, the IL28B genotype is included in the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the European Association for the Study of the Liver guidelines [19,20]. As a result, physicians should consider testing IL28B in patients with hepatitis C; however, the implementation of routine genotyping has been halted in tertiary care hospitals because of the need for molecular biology tools that are expensive and highly complex.The CTPP multiplex assay described here detects in a single reaction the genotypes C/C, C/T, and T/T. All samples evaluated with CTPP (n = 211) presented agreement with sequencing. The analysis of 71 samples with real time PCR also presented agreement with the genotype as demonstrated in table 2. The PCR-CTPP was validated in 211 patients with chronic hepatitis C; Table 3 shows the IL28B genotyping and the results of standard treatment with PEG-IFN/RBV. 10.1371/journal.pone.0078142.t002Table 2 distribution of genotypes according to the methods.

The inter-technician kappa’s ranged from 0.92 to 1.0, indicating excellent inter-technician reliability (Kappa’s obtained from 22 samples).  We used three positive controls (a sample of each genotype) to ensure the reliability of results. The cost of each reaction was US$ 184,12, US$ 174,56 and US$ 31.57 for the direct sequencing, Real time PCR and  PCR-CTPP respectively. Regarding the time, sequencing took an average of 850 minutes, the real time PCR took an average of 310 minutes and the PCR-CTPP an average of 460 minutes.Only the direct cost of reagents  was analyzed. However, if we had considered the cost of equipment, maintenance and labor the difference between the costs of methodologies would be even less for PCR CTPP, as it uses only a thermocycler and a set of electrophoresis ."
