"IFNL3 and IFNL4 genotyping
Overall, 726 out of 1006 (72%) individuals have been genotyped for IFNL3 rs12979860 and 687 samples were tested for IFNL3 rs8099917 (Fig 1). Additionally, 631 samples could be genotyped for IFN-L4 ss469415590. The genotype distribution of the IFNL4 double nucleotide polymorphism and the two IFNL3 SNPs was in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The overall genotype distribution of IFNL3 rs8099917 TT, GT, and GG was 64.3%, 31.4%, and 4.2% and the distribution of rs12979860 CC, CT, and TT was 41.5%, 45.7%, and 12.8%, respectively. For IFNL4 ss469415590 TT/TT, TT/ ΔG, and ΔG/ΔG were seen in 40.9%, 46.1%, and 13.0% of patients, respectively. Concordance in IFNL3 genotyping in EDTA whole blood and serum
Testing for IFNL3 rs12979860, IFNL3 rs8099917 and IFNL4 ss469415590 was not scheduled in the initiation phase of this registry and was performed with available stored EDTA whole blood samples and/ or serum samples as illustrated in Fig 1.
Overall, in almost all samples concordant results between serum and EDTA whole blood samples were observed in IFNL3 rs12979860 and rs8099917 genotypes with concordance rates of 99% (132 out of 134) and 96% (120 out of 125), respectively.
In those two cases with discordance for rs12979860 genotype one patient had CT in EDTA whole blood and CC in serum and the other had TT in EDTA whole blood and CC in serum (Fig 1). For genotyping of rs8099917 discordant results were observed in five cases (1 sample: GT (EDTA) vs. GG (serum); 2 samples: GT (EDTA) vs. TT (serum); 2 samples: TT (EDTA) vs. GT (serum)) (Fig 1). IFLN4 ss469415590 in Caucasian patients with HCV G2/3
In addition, serum samples of 631 patients were tested for IFLN4 genotype. The overall genotype distribution of IFNL4 ss469415590 TT/TT, TT/ΔG, and ΔG/ΔG was 40.9%, 46.1%, and 13.0%. We observed a very high correlation between IFNL3 (rs12979860) and IFN-L4 (ss469415590) (r = 0.9777; p<0.0001). IFNL3 (rs12979860) CC was associated with IFN-L4 (ss469415590) TT/TT in 99.2% of patients. IFNL3 (rs12979860) CT was linked with IFN-L4 (ss469415590) TT/ΔG (98.0%) and IFNL3 (rs12979860) TT was associated with IFN-L4 (ss469415590) ΔG/ΔG (97.6%). Treatment response in correlation with IFNL3 and IFLN4 genotypes
Due to the high association between IFNL3 (rs12979860) and IFN-L4 (ss469415590) we only used IFNL3 SNPs for further analyses. There was no statistical difference considering SVR rates in ITT as well as PP analysis in different SNPs (rs12979860 and rs8099917) of IFNL3 (Table 1 and Fig 2A). The so-called preferable genotypes CC-rs12979860 and TT- rs8099917 showed higher RVR rates compared to the non-preferable ones (82% vs. 63%; p<0.0001 and 80% vs. 55%; p<0.0001) (Fig 2B). 10.1371/journal.pone.0145622.g002

0.50 * Chi square test During this study period we observed 32 relapses and only 5 breakthroughs in the per-protocol analysis. The majority of patients with relapse were HCV genotype 3 (n = 27; 84%) and had more often the favorable genotype TT-rs8099917 rather than non-TT-rs8099917 (n = 16 (62%) vs. n = 10 (38%)). In contrast, the favorable genotype CC-rs12979860 was observed in the minority of patients with relapse (n = 11 (39%) vs. n = 17 (61%)). Correlation of IFNL3 genotypes and treatment response in different HCV genotypes
The overall SVR was high (91%) for both HCV genotypes. However, patients infected with HCV genotype 2 had significantly higher SVR rates than patients with HCV genotype 3 (96% vs. 90%; p = 0.0479). Week 4 responses were comparable to SVR results but without being statistical significant (78% vs. 70%; p = 0.0520).
The preferable genotype distribution of both SNPs was similar in GT2 and GT3 (rs12979860: 44% vs. 41%; p = 0.5563 and rs8099917: 66% vs. 64%; p = 0.6449) (Table 2). Regarding SVR rates, there were no statistical significant differences between preferable and non-preferable IFNL3 genotype in HCV genotype 2 and 3 (Fig 2C and 2D). Patients with HCV genotype 3 had significantly higher RVR rates if both preferable IFNL3 SNPs were present (CC 80% vs. non-CC 61%; p<0.0001 and TT 79% vs. Non-TT 53%; p<0.0001) (Fig 2E). In patients with HCV genotype 2 only IFNL3 rs8099917 and not rs12979860 showed significant differences in RVR rates (TT: 84% vs. non-TT: 63%; p = 0.0162; CC: 86% vs. non CC: 71%; p = 0.0606) (Fig 2F). 10.1371/journal.pone.0145622.t002

0.6449 Predictor of treatment responses
Pretreatment clinical variables and on-treatment responses were analyzed considering association to SVR. Only younger age, stage of liver fibrosis, HCV genotype and RVR were linked with SVR-PP in a univariate analysis. All parameters with a p-value ≤0.05 were considered for multivariate analysis. Only RVR was independently associated with SVR-PP in multivariate analysis (p<0.001) (Table 3). A retrospective power analysis showed a requirement of n>383 for rs12979860 genotype and n>391 for rs8099917 genotype in order to have 90% power to detect an odds ratio of 2 with a p-value of 0.05. SVR-ITT analyses fulfilled these criteria and in addition revealed an effect of gender and BMI in the univariate analysis, but only RVR remained independently correlated with SVR (Table 3). 10.1371/journal.pone.0145622.t003

Patients with HCV genotype 2 and 3 had similar median levels of HCV RNA at baseline (6.2±1.6 log10 IU/mL vs. 5.7±1.4 log10 IU/mL; p = 0.1838). However, in HCV genotype 2 the frequency of patients with high viral load above 800,000 IU/mL was significantly higher compared to genotype 3 patients (62% vs. 44%; p<0.0001).
Patients with CC genotype (rs12979860) had significantly higher median baseline HCV RNA levels compared with non-CC genotype (6.1±1.2 log10 IU/mL vs. 5.6±1.0 log10 IU/mL; p = 0.0292) and had more often high viral load (57% vs. 41%; p<0.0001) (Fig 3A). Interestingly, these differences seen in the overall population could be observed only in HCV genotype 3 patients. The association between rs8099917 genotypes and HCV viral load revealed similar results (TT: 6.0±1.2 log10 IU/mL vs. non-TT: 5.6±1.0 log10 IU/mL; p = 0.0362) (Fig 3B). 10.1371/journal.pone.0145622.g003

Patients with genotype 3 and low viral load, defined as HCV RNA below 800,000 IU/mL at baseline, achieved more often RVR (74% vs 64%; p = 0.0074) (Fig 4). Low viral load at baseline and each favorable genotype were associated with significantly higher RVR rates. Individuals with favorable IFNL3 genotype and low viral load at baseline compared to patients with non-favorable IFNL3 genotype and high viral load at baseline, had more pronounced differences in RVR rates (rs12979860: 87% vs. 48%; p<0.0001 and rs8099917: 87% vs. 30%; p<0.0001) (Fig 4). In patients with beneficial IFNL3 genotype but high viral load RVR rates were comparable to individuals with non-beneficial genotype but low viral load, (rs12979860: 76% vs. 70%; p = 0.3264 and rs8099917: 72% vs. 67%; p = 0.3836) (Fig 4). 10.1371/journal.pone.0145622.g004
Fig 4 RVR in HCV genotype 3 according to baseline viral load in relation to IFNL3 genotype. Data with those virological and IFNL3 configuration considering SVR rates are located in the supporting information (S1A Fig).
The same analyses, considering RVR and SVR rates, have been performed for G2 patients with similar results in parts (S1B and S1C Fig). However, the numbers of patients in the subgroups were low.
In this large cohort of more than 600 patients chronically infected with HCV genotype 2 or 3 and available IFNL3 data we could show (i) association of IFNL3 and IFNL4 with RVR rather than SVR, (ii) strong association between IFNL4 ss469415590 and IFNL3 rs12979860 genotypes (iii) and high concordance between IFNL3 genotypes determined in serum and in EDTA-blood.The role for IFNL3 or IFNL4 testing for patients with genotype 2 and 3 still remains controversial. Many studies have shown an association of IFL3 and RVR but not SVR ([14–19]). However, recently, Eslam et al. [18] demonstrated a high association of both preferable SNPs with SVR rates. Eslam et al. discussed that prior studies [14–19] revealed no association of IFNL3 SNPs with SVR because patient numbers in those studies were too low to have the ability to detect any effect of IFNL3 SNPs on the outcome of treatment. In order to refute a lack of power due to high SVR rates in PP analysis a retrospective power analysis considering SVR ITT results was performed. Therefore, the number of included individuals in this study should be sufficient. However, despite the high number of patients included in this registry, neither in the PP nor in the ITT analysis an association between INFL3 SNPs and SVR could be observed. However, there was a linkage between IFNL3 SNPs and RVR and RVR remained the only independent factor associated with SVR in multivariate analysis. This was consistent with previous studies [23–28]. There are some limitations in our but also in the study by Eslam. Neither study is a prospective clinical trial. In Eslams study a fixed treatment duration of 24 weeks was implemented, whereas in this registry each participating physician could determine individual therapy durations, leading in general to an overtherapy like we published before [13]. Eslam et al., did not report the ribavirin doses actually used, which may impact the response in more difficult to treat patients. In our registry the recommendation were based on the German Clinical Practice Guideline (12–15 mg/kg) [23] and is often higher compared to the fixed 800mg dose initially suggested [30]. Our patients received 13.7 mg/kg in average. Our registry only included naïve patients while the study by Eslam et al., did not report if the patients were naïve or have been treated with PEG-IFN/RBV before [18]. Also the number of patients with moderate/severe fibrosis was higher in the study by Eslam. The association of IFNL3 and SVR may be lost in naïve easier to treat patients. The study by Eslam also included not only Caucasian patient.Although there was no association between IFNL3 SNPs to SVR, a strong association to RVR was present and RVR remains the strongest factor for achieving SVR. In the end this may be even the more relevant association in the times of new emerging DAA therapies. In those “easy-to-treat” patients with low viral load, no signs of cirrhosis and the important milestone RVR, combination therapy of Peg-IFN and RBV may still be considered as first line treatment option. This concept is far less expensive [13] and could save resources for the more difficult to treat patients (cirrhosis, non-RVR) which should be treated with DAAs. We therefore suggest that the preferred patient populations for IFNL3 testing are naïve genotype 2 and especially naïve genotype 3 patients with low baseline viremia and without signs of cirrhosis. For example, G3 patients positive for IFNL3 CC genotype had 80% RVR of whom 94% achieved SVR in the PP analysis with a median of 24 weeks PEG-IFN/RBV.In a recent study Susser et al. showed that IFN-L4 genotype was the best single predictor for SVR in genotype 3 infected patients [22]. However, we could not observe better predictive values for IFNL4 compared to IFNL3 in Genotype 3 patients. In the study of Susser et al. a high association of IFNL4 ss469415590 and IFNL3 rs12979860 was as well observed. Additionally, in their study they investigated only 191 patients with HCV genotype 3 which might influence results. Finally, the calculated p-value of 0.044 for the association of IFNL4 ss469415590 and SVR was only borderline significant.Analysis of host genetic polymorphism usually requires EDTA blood. Sometimes, retrospective analyses of large cohorts are not possible due to the lack of stored samples. One of our other aims in this study was to assess if IFNL3 and IFNL4 genotyping was possible from serum samples. Our study revealed high concordance and in case of discordance results differed only by one base. Initially 712 samples had to be retested for IFNL3 genotyping with 687 cases (97%) revealing results for both SNPs. Thus, IFNL3 polymorphisms could easily be analysed from stored serum samples.In conclusion, IFNL3 polymorphisms testing may be a tool for genotype 2/3 patients to decide if dual Peg-IFN/RBV therapy is an option to save resources in the times of new DAA therapies. IFNL4 showed similar predictive value in Caucasian patients and is not recommended in this setting."
