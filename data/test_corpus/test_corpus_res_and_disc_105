"Characteristics of the patients
A total of 22 patients received treatment with NTZ plus Peg-IFN/RBV at 10 centers in Spain. One patient was found to be infected by genotype 1a by sequencing in a subsequent study and, thus, was excluded from this analysis (Fig 1). The main baseline features of the 21 patients included in the trial and of those recruited in the historical cohort are summarized in Table 1. All individuals were on ART and showed undetectable plasma HIV-RNA. Fourteen (67%) patients had advanced fibrosis, i.e. liver stiffness ≥9.5 kPa, and nearly half of the patients showed cirrhosis. Most individuals had baseline plasma HCV-RNA ≥800000 IU/mL and non-CC IL28B genotype (Table 1). 10.1371/journal.pone.0143492.g001

Two (9.5%) of 21 patients included in the trial compared with 5 (21.7%) of 23 patients included in the historical cohort achieved SVR (SVR risk difference, -12.2%; 95% confidence interval, -33.2% to 8.8%; p = 0.416). The median (Q1-Q3) plasma HCV-RNA at baseline, i.e at starting the lead-in phase with NTZ, was 6.34 (5.31–7.66) log10 IU/mL and at week 4 of the lead-in phase with NTZ was 6.59 (5.88–7.87) log10 IU/mL (p = 0.712). After starting Peg-IFN/RBV plus NTZ, none of the patients reached undetectable plasma HCV-RNA at week 4. At week 12, 10 (47.6%) individuals discontinued therapy because of lack of response. At week 24, three (14.3%) subjects did not reach undetectable plasma HCV-RNA. One (4.7%) patient showed viral breakthrough at week 28. Thus, virological failure was due to lack of response in 13 (62%) individuals. Two (9.5%) individuals experienced viral relapse after the end of treatment. Two (9.5%) individuals voluntarily dropped out. Virological response in the trial compared with the historical cohort is summarized in Fig 2. 10.1371/journal.pone.0143492.g002

The most common adverse events were fatigue, anorexia and insomnia (Table 2). Other less frequent side effects were depression, myalgia, headache, itching, diarrhea, rash, irritability, local reaction at the site of injection. One patient suffered bacterial pneumonia. Two (9.5%) patients discontinued permanently due to adverse events, one of them because of symptomatic anemia and the other one due to severe rash. Interruption due to adverse events in the historical cohort was reported in 2 (8.7%) patients. The most common grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities were anemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. RBV dose was not decreased in any patient and erythropoietin was used in 2 (9.5%) individuals because of anemia. The dose of Peg-IFN was not reduced in any patient with neutropenia. 10.1371/journal.pone.0143492.t002

†Serious adverse events were defined as fatal or life-threatening events and as those that required or prolonged hospitalization, resulted in persistent or clinically significant disability or congenital anomaly, or required a medical or surgical intervention to preclude permanent impairment of body function or structure. In this pilot clinical trial, no increase in SVR was observed among HIV/HCV-4-coinfected patients receiving Peg-IFN/RBV plus NTZ compared with a historical cohort treated with Peg-IFN/RBV. Interruptions due to adverse events of Peg-IFN/RBV plus NTZ were similar to those of Peg-IFN/RBV.This is the first clinical trial assessing Peg-IFN/RBV plus NTZ among HIV/HCV-4-coinfected patients. This trial did not confirm the increased SVR of Peg-IFN/RBV plus NTZ found in HCV-4-monoinfected patients. In previous trials in Egyptian HCV-4-infected patients, the SVR frequency of those receiving Peg-IFN/RBV plus NTZ was close to 80%, i.e. 30% greater than that of individuals assigned to Peg-IFN/RBV [13, 14]. On the contrary, we observed a far lower SVR to Peg-IFN/RBV plus NTZ for HIV/HCV-4 coinfection, without differences with a historical control receiving Peg-IFN/RBV. There is no clear explanation for these contrasting results. One possible reason is that those trials were designed before the effect of IL28B on response to therapy was described. Among patients carrying HCV-4 with or without HIV coinfection, IL28B variations exert a dramatic influence on SVR [8, 9, 15], even stronger than in HCV-1 infection. Differences in IL28B in those initial trials might partly explain the contrasting results between studies. In addition, individuals of Egyptian ancestry seem to achieve better frequency of SVR to therapy against HCV-4 [13] than subjects of other ancestries [15, 16]. Furthermore, HIV infection might also be another reason for the lack of effect of the addition of NTZ to Peg/RBV on SVR.Our results are in agreement with those reported in the ACTG A5269 [17]. That was a pilot clinical trial to assess the efficacy of Peg-IFN alpha 2a and RBV plus NTZ for HIV and genotype 1 (HCV-1)-coinfected treatment-naïve patients. The addition of NTZ to Peg-IFN alpha 2a plus RBV did not improve SVR among HIV/HCV-1-coinfected subjects naïve to HCV therapy in comparison to historical control data [17]. However, the frequency of virological response at week 12 of Peg-IFN alpha 2a and RBV plus NTZ was higher than those of HIV/HCV-1-coinfected naïve patients treated with Peg-IFN alpha 2a and RBV in the ACTG A5178, a previously completed trial used as historical control [17]. This initial advantage for NTZ plus Peg-IFN/RBV was not translated into a higher HCV clearance. In our study, the main reason for lack of SVR was on treatment virological failure. Indeed, nearly half of the patients showed null response at week 12. Thus, we did not find any benefit throughout treatment from the addition of NTZ to Peg-IFN/RBV among HIV/HCV-4-coinfected patients. This disparity between these trials might be due to the different HCV genotypes tested, HCV-1 vs. HCV-4. In addition, it is also possible that the use of Peg-IFN alpha 2a in the ACTG A5269 and of Peg-IFN alpha 2b in the present trial might have influenced those differences. In this regard, treatment of HCV-4 infection with Peg-IFN alpha 2a achieves a higher proportion of response at week 12 than Peg-IFN alpha 2b with similar final SVR frequency [18].HCV-4 is not infrequently found in HIV/HCV coinfection [3, 4, 7–9]. However, very few data is available on the treatment of HCV-4 in HIV-coinfected patients. Several clinical trials have explored the efficacy of Peg-IFN/RBV plus a DAA in HCV-4 monoinfection [19–21]. Regarding IFN-free regimens, there is data supporting the use of ritonavir-boosted paritaprevir plus ombitasvir plus RBV for HCV-4-monoinfected patients [22]. In a small group of HIV/HCV-4-coinfected patients, promising responses were achieved with SOF plus RBV for 24 weeks [23]. There is anecdotal information on SOF plus DCV in one naïve and two treatment-experienced HIV/HCV-4-coinfected individuals [11]. Theoretically, combinations including SOF plus SMV or DCV plus SMV should be highly active against HCV-4, but currently there is no data available for those regimens. Thus, unfortunately, it is presently unclear what the best treatment options for HCV-4 in HIV coinfection are.Some limitations of this study are due to the design as pilot clinical trial. There was no randomized comparison with a control group, because this was an exploratory trial. The sample size was small and calculated using HCV-4 monoinfection data [13, 14]. The difference in SVR between groups of HCV-4-monoinfected patients receiving Peg-IFN/RBV with or without NTZ was assumed as potentially achievable by HIV/HCV-4-coinfected patients. The final sample size of the study was even smaller due to an early termination warranted after an efficacy interim analysis. However, given the trends observed, it is highly unlikely that a larger sample size would have changed the conclusions reached herein. Another limitation could be related with the differences in baseline variables between the study group and the historical cohort. Particularly, variables that may potentially adversely influence SVR were more frequent in the study group, such as the proportion of patients with high plasma HCV RNA levels or the frequency of cirrhosis. However, we had previously shown that the only factor predictive of SVR to Peg-IFN/RBV among HIV/HCV-4-coinfected patients is IL28B (ref. 8, Mira et al. AIDS 2012,26:1721–1724). There were no significant differences in the proportion of IL28B CC variation between the NTZ treatment group and the historical cohort.It has been suggested that combinations of NTZ or other thiazolides with DAA for treating chronic hepatitis C may be a path for future development of that drug [24]. However, we failed to find any data supporting that NTZ should be considered a possible agent to be included in drug combinations to treat HCV-4 in HIV coinfection. HCV treatment is a rapidly evolving field with very few data supporting some potential IFN-free treatment options for HCV-4 infection in patients living with HIV. Studies aimed at assessing combinations against HCV-4 are needed before any assumption of antiviral activity is made in the specific setting of HIV infection."
