"The majority of patients were male (62%) and infected with HCV genotype 1 (69%). When comparing HCV genotype 1 and 3 infected patients, they differed significantly. The HCV genotype 1 patients were older (median age 53 vs. 47 years for genotype 1 and 3 respectively, p<0.0001), had a longer duration of infection (median 30 vs. 25 years for genotype 1 and 3 respectively, p<0,0001), had higher BMI (26 vs. 25 kg/m2 for genotype 1 and 3 respectively, p = 0.04), and were less likely to have been infected through intravenous drug use (50% vs. 64% genotype 1 and 3 respectively, p = 0.03). A strong association was noted between the distribution of HCV genotypes and IL28B SNP variants (P<0.0001; Figure 2), with CC at rs12979860 being significantly more common in treatment-naïve patients with HCV genotype 2 or 3 infection than genotype 1. Treatment-experienced patients were excluded from this latter analysis in order to avoid potential bias resulting from differing treatment response.10.1371/journal.pone.0080172.g002Figure 2

Chi-squared (χ2)-test was used to compare differences in distribution.
A valid liver stiffness measurement was obtained in 614 patients (83%). In general patients with invalid examinations were older than those with valid (median age 54 and 52 years, p = 0.004), and had significantly higher body-mass index (BMI) (28 and 25 kg/m2, p<0.0001). These findings were in line with a previous reported 5-year prospective study of 13,369 liver stiffness measurements, where unreliable results were noted in nearly one of five examinations, with obesity and old age being main causes [36].Among HCV genotype 3 infected patients with CC at rs12979860, significantly higher liver stiffness values (median 8.2 vs. 6.4 kPa for CC and CT/TT respectively, P = 0.004; Figure 3) as well as APRI (median 1.0 vs. 0.6 for CC and CT/TT respectively, P = 0.02; Figure 4), were noted as compared to Trs12979860 allele carriers. Conversely, among HCV genotype 1 infected patients with CC genotype, a non-significant trend towards lower liver stiffness values and APRI were noted. There were no significant differences in age, gender, BMI or duration of infection between CC and CT/TT carriers in neither genotype 1 nor genotype 3 infected patients (Table 2). These results were unchanged when patients with unreliable liver stiffness measurements were excluded. No significant associations were observed among the 67 HCV genotype 2 infected patients, although a trend was noted towards slightly more pronounced liver pathology among CC carriers (median liver stiffness 9.2 vs. 7.0 kPa for CC and CT/TT respectively, P = 0.13), (median APRI 0.8 vs. 0.5 for CC and CT/TT respectively, P = 0.19). All of the abovementioned results remained unchanged if treatment-experienced patients were excluded from the analyses. No association was noted between alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and IL28B genetic variants.10.1371/journal.pone.0080172.g003Figure 3

The following variables remained independently predictive in multivariate analysis of greater liver stiffness in HCV genotype 1 infected patients: older age (P<0.001), higher ALT (P<0.0001), and male gender (P = 0.011). For HCV genotype 3 infected patients, older age (P<0.0001), higher ALT (P = 0.001), CC at rs12979860 (P = 0.017), and male gender (P = 0.029) were independently predictive of more pronounced liver stiffness. HCV genotype 2 infected patients could not be evaluated in multivariate analysis due to the small sample size.This study confirms previous reports that CCrs12979860 carriage is associated with more pronounced liver pathology in patients chronically infected with HCV genotype 3 as compared to genotype 1. Abe et al. reported that among Japanese patients infected with HCV genotype 1 or 2, patients with homozygous carriage of the IL28B major allele had significantly more severe inflammatory activity and fibrosis, indicating that this SNP genotype may not be beneficial outside the context of therapeutic intervention [25]. Similarly Bochud et al. [37] analyzed the association between IL28B polymorphisms and liver histology among 1527 chronically HCV-infected Caucasian patients and noted that the rare IL28B Grs8099917 allele, which has been associated with poor response to therapy, entailed less hepatic inflammation and fibrosis. When stratifying for HCV genotype, important differences were noted, and the findings were statistically significant for genotype 3 only. In agreement with the findings of Bochud et al., we recently presented results from a pegylated interferon-α2a and ribavirin trial for treatment naïve HCV genotype 2/3 patients (NORDynamIC study) [38]. In this trial, which included 314 Caucasian patients who were evaluated for IL28B polymorphisms, pretreatment liver biopsies were mandatory and centrally evaluated for liver fibrosis and inflammation using the Ishak protocol as well as steatosis. The IL28B Grs8099917 allele was significantly associated with milder fibrosis among HCV genotyped 3 infected patients, with a similar non-significant trend observed for IL28B Trs12979860, but not for genotype 2 [27], [28]. Similarly, IL28B Trs12979860 carriage in HCV genotype 3 infected patients was associated with less steatosis, whereas IL28B Grs8099917 carriage in HCV genotype 2 was associated with less steatosis.Liver pathology in the present study was evaluated by means of liver stiffness measurement rather than liver biopsy. Thus it was not possible to ascertain which histopathological components contributed to the elevated measurements among HCV genotype 3 infected CC carriers, although the concomitantly elevated APRI suggests that more pronounced fibrosis weighed in. It should be noted that elevated ALT reportedly confounds the use of transient elastography among HCV infected patients [39]. However, in the present study ALT was not associated with IL28B genetic variants, and in the multivariate analysis among HCV genotype 3 infected patients, both higher ALT and IL28B CCrs12979860 carriage were independently predictive of the elevated liver stiffness measurement. Although transient elastography has a high degree of accuracy and reproducibility in prediction of liver fibrosis in the context of HCV infection, there are conflicting reports as to the impact of steatosis on Fibroscan® measurements. Arena et al. observed no influence of steatosis on transient elastography [40], whereas Sanchez-Conde et al. [41] and Boursier et al. [42] noted significant associations. However, in the latter two studies the influence of steatosis was noted predominately among patients with high-grade steatosis.It is unclear how CC genotype carriage, in the context of HCV genotype 3 infection, may induce more pronounced liver pathology. Rembeck et al. previously suggested that the underlying mechanism of action might be secondary to higher baseline viral loads [27], [28], [29], although in the present study no significant association was noted between viral load and liver stiffness. Elevated HCV RNA levels in HCV genotype 3 infection have previously been reported to be associated with the increased presence and severity of steatosis [43], [44], which in turn entails accelerated fibrosis progression [45], suggestive of a cytopathic effect of HCV genotype 3 virus. On a similar note, it was recently reported that the cumulative mortality of HCV genotype 3 infected US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) patients failing to achieve SVR after therapy was higher than among non-SVR patients infected with genotypes 1 or 2 [46]. How the HCV genotype 3 virus exerts this cytopathic effect remains to be determined, though previously it has been hypothesized that the greater propensity for development of steatosis, than observed for other HCV genotypes [43], [45], may be secondary to a greater impairment of lipid export from infected hepatocytes [47], [48] possibly mediated by inhibition of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) [49], [50] or due to increased availability of free fatty acids by reduced oxidation or by increased de novo synthesis [51], [52], [53], [54] mediated by the HCV genotype 3 core protein.Due to the retrospective design, details regarding alcohol intake were not recorded. Similarly, according to clinical routine, information regarding ethnicity was also not recorded in medical charts at the participating centers. However, when considering the local populations of HCV-infected individuals in Sweden, it is reasonable to assume that the overwhelming majority of patients included were Caucasians of Scandinavian origin.Our finding that homozygous CC at rs12979860 was significantly more common in the setting of treatment-naïve HCV genotype 2 or 3 infection than genotype 1 corroborates previous reports [8], [18]. Indeed, the proportion of CC at rs12979860 among HCV genotype 2 and 3 infected patients (40% and 45%, respectively) in our study is similar to the reported prevalence in HCV uninfected Caucasians (∼40%), suggesting that this SNP genotype may be less beneficial following exposure to HCV genotype 2 or 3 as compared to genotype 1.In conclusion, the present study demonstrated an association between CC carriage at rs12979860 and more pronounced liver stiffness values and APRI among HCV genotype 3 infected patients. In this light, analysis of IL28B genotype may be beneficial among HCV genotype 3 infected patients so as to encourage homozygous CC rs12979860 carriers to initiate therapy. Additionally, the finding that IL28B variability did not significantly impact on liver stiffness measurement among HCV genotype 1 and 2 infected patients and that CC rs12979860 was more common among genotype 2/3 infected patients, implies that IL28B may differentially regulate the course of HCV infection across genotypes."
