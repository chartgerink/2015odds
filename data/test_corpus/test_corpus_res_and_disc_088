One hundred seventy-seven HIV/HCV coinfected patients were included. Out of those 70 (39.5%) patients were also included in the previous study of our group [24]. The majority of patients was male (75.7%) with a mean age of 38.6±9.9 years and BMI of 23.1±4.3 kg*m-2. Forty-two patients (23.7%) had a history of or current alcohol abuse. The most common route of infection was intravenous drug-use (IVDU, 72.9%) with a mean duration of infection of 11.5±10.0 years. Most patients (66.7%) had high levels of HCV-RNA (>6*105 IU/mL) and were on cART (83.1%) and thus, showed low HIV viremia (1.91±1.1 log10 copies/mL). Immune status was well preserved as reflected by a mean CD4+ T lymphocyte (CD4+) cell count of 528±263 cells/μL.
In regard to PNPLA3, nine patients (5.1%) were tested positive for the major PNPLA3 risk genotype (G/G), 66 (37.3%) for the minor risk genotype (G/C) and 102 (57.6%) had no risk allele (C/C). The distribution of IL28B genotype was: 18 (10.2%), 101 (57.1%) and 57 (32.2%) for T/T, T/C and C/C, respectively. Liver disease parameters (Table 1, Fig 2) 10.1371/journal.pone.0143429.g002

Abbreviations: PNPLA3 (patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 3), SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism), HVPG (hepatic venous pressure gradient), CAP™ (Controlled Attenuation Parameter). Thirty-one (17.5%) patients had METAVIR F0 fibrosis, 45 (25.4%) F1, 58 (32.8%) F2, 20 (11.3%) showed bridging fibrosis (F3), and 23 (13.0%) had established cirrhosis (F4). The mean fibrosis progression rate (FPR) was 0.23±0.33 METAVIR F-units/year. Mean AST and ALT were 66.5±43.7 IU/mL and 88.7±82.8 IU/mL, respectively. The majority of patients showed elevated levels of AST (60.0%) and ALT (65.5%).
34 patients (19.2%) underwent non-invasive steatosis assessment showing CAP results of 209.5±51.1dB/m. HVPG was measured in 69 (39.0%) patients who had a mean HVPG value of 4.2±2.8mmHg. Elevated portal pressure (HVPG≥6mmHg) was observed in 13 patients (18.8%) and clinically significant portal hypertension (HVPG ≥10mmHg) in 4 patients (5.8%) [34]. Influence of PNPLA3 risk alleles on liver disease (Table 1, Fig 2)
Almost half of the patients (n = 75, 42.4%) were tested positive for a PNPLA3 major or minor risk allele (G/G or G/C). Most importantly, the prevalence of established risk factors for advanced fibrosis or accelerated fibrosis progression (such as prior alcohol abuse, HCV-GT3, low CD4+ nadir, etc.) was comparable between patients with and without PNPLA3 risk alleles. The (estimated) duration of HCV infection was similar in patients with PNPLA3 C/C, when compared to patients with PNPLA3 C/G or G/G with 11.3±9.2 and 11.8±11.1 years, respectively (p = 0.88). Patients with a PNPLA3 risk allele showed significantly higher ALT-levels (109.0±103.5 vs. 74.1±60.0 IU/mL; p = 0.02) and AST-levels (74.8±45.8 vs. 60.5±41.3 IU/mL; p = 0.03). Moreover, there was a trend toward higher y-GT-levels (146.5±129.3 vs. 113.5±106.0 IU/mL; p = 0.06) when compared to patients without a PNPLA3 risk allele. There was no difference in METAVIR fibrosis stage (both median F2 (range 1–4; p = 0.11)), nor mean liver stiffness (median 6.8 (3.3) vs. 6.4 (3.9)kPa; p = 0.33) between patients with and without a PNPLA3 risk allele. Comparison of PNPLA3 risk allele prevalence between patients with or without advanced fibrosis
One fourth of patients (n = 43, 24.3%) had advanced fibrosis (F3/F4). Not surprisingly, patients with advanced fibrosis showed a significantly longer duration of infection (16.2±9.6 vs. 10.0±9.7 years; p<0.01), a significantly lower CD4+ cell count (465±271 vs. 549±258cells/μL; p = 0.02), a significantly lower CD4-nadir (207±166 vs. 296±206 cells/μL; p = 0.01), and lower HDL-Cholesterol (40±17 vs. 49±18mg/dL; p<0.01). HCV-GT 3 was overrepresented in the group of patients with advanced fibrosis (42% vs. 15%; p<0.01). Patients with advanced fibrosis were more likely to be subsequently treated with PEGIFN/RBV than patients without advanced fibrosis (72% vs. 52%; p = 0.02). However, the distribution of PNPLA3 non-C/C (44.8% vs. 34.9%; p = 0.25) and IL28B non-C/C (68.7% vs. 62.8%; p = 0.63) SNPs was comparable between both groups.

- Factors associated with advanced fibrosis in HIV/HCV coinfection in an univariable as well as a multivariable analysis; factors in univariable analysis are shown as mean ± SD or number (percentage) of patients; on the right side all factors included in the multivariable analysis are shown, factors written in bold remained in the final model; Abbreviations: UVA (univariable analysis), MVA (multivariable analysis). The binary logistic regression model (Model A) comprises variables, which were associated with advanced liver fibrosis in univariate analysis. In addition, we included well-established risk factors for liver disease progression in HCV-monoinfected patients as covariates. HCV GT 3 (OR: 4.18; 95% CI: 1.62–10.80; p = 0.003), higher age (OR: 1.87; 95% CI: 1.19–2.94; p = 0.007) and higher BMI (OR: 1.14; 95% CI: 1.04–1.26; p = 0.008) were independent risk factors for advanced liver fibrosis. Moreover, there was a trend toward an increased risk of advanced fibrosis in patients with low CD4 nadir (OR: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.63–1.01; p = 0.058). In contrast, advanced liver fibrosis was not associated with PNPLA3 G-allele (OR: 0.70; 95% CI: 0.28–1.76; p = 0.446), longer duration of infection (OR: 1.16; 95% CI: 0.66–2.05; p = 0.600), HCV-RNA levels (OR 1.19; 95% CI 0.80–1.78; p = 0.386), alcohol abuse (OR 1.41; 95% CI: 0.56–3.58; p = 0.466) and AST-levels (OR: 1.02; 95% CI: 0.92–1.14; p = 0.679). Thus, we did not observe an association between PNPLA3 and advanced liver fibrosis when adjusting for other relevant factors. Liver steatosis in patients with or without PNPLA3 risk allele (Table 1, Fig 2)
Liver steatosis—as assessed by CAP—was comparable between patients with PNPLA3 C/C and PNPLA3 non-C/C patients (215.5±59.7 vs. 203.5±41.9dB/m; p = 0.56). Subgroup analysis of patients with available HVPG-measurement
Sixty-nine (39.0%) patients underwent HVPG-measurement and almost half of those patients (n = 29, 42.0%) were tested positive for a PNPLA3 major or minor risk genotype. Harbouring a PNPLA3-risk allele in this subgroup of patients was associated with a non-significant trend towards a higher bilirubin levels (0.93±0.73 vs. 0.74±0.47 mg/dL;p = 0.07) as well as higher ALT levels (109.6±89.3 vs. 71.6±47.0; p = 0.09). The mean HVPG-value, however, was comparable between patients with and without a risk allele (3.9 ±2.6 vs. 4.4±3.0mmHg; p = 0.47).
Similarly to the results obtained in the entire cohort, there were no differences in presence of advanced fibrosis (24.1% vs. 42.5%; p = 0.11) and CAP-value (p = 0.27) between patients with and without PNPLA3 risk alleles. Influence of PNPLA3 on fibrosis progression, hepatic steatosis and HVPG after exclusion of HCV GT-3 patients
After excluding n = 38 HIV/HCV-GT3 patients for this subgroup analysis, the results were comparable to those obtained from the entire cohort with similar FPR (0.28±0.44 vs. 0.21±0.30, p = 0.838), similar amount of hepatic steatosis (CAP: 200.6±41.6 vs. 196.8±39.8, p = 0.851) and similar degree of portal hypertension (HVPG: 3.5±1.5 vs. 3.6±2.1, p = 0.752) across PNPLA3 genotypes.

0.221 Virologic response rates (rapid virological response, complete early virological response and sustained virological response) to PEGIFN/RBV by PNPLA3-SNP and IL28B-SNP; reported as number (percentage) of patients; Abbreviations: PNPLA3 (patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 3), IL28B (interleukin 28B), RVR (rapid virological response), cEVR (complete early virological response), SVR (sustained virological response). 101 (57.1%) patients received antiviral therapy with PEGIFN/RBV. Among these, fifty-eight (57.4%) patients achieved sustained virologic response (SVR).
When comparing the SVR rates between patients with major, minor or no PNPLA3 risk allele after grouping patients according to their IL28B-genotype, there was no statistically significant difference: Both RVR rates (p = 0.37 for IL28B-C/C, p = 0.12 for IL28B-T/C, and p = 0.62 for IL28B-T/T) and cEVR rates (p = 0.43 for IL28B-C/C; p = 0.34 for IL28B-T/C, and p = 0.56 for IL28B-T/T) were similar across different PNPLA3 genotypes. Moreover, SVR rates (p = 0.26 for IL28B-C/C, p = 0.65 for IL28B-T/C and p = 0.22 for IL28B-T/T) were similar in all PNPLA3 groups.
Our study provides novel data on the impact of a PNPLA3 risk allele on liver fibrosis progression in HIV/HCV coinfection. In addition, this is also the first study to investigate the influence of the PNPLA3 on development of hepatic steatosis and portal hypertension in a large cohort of the special population of HIV/HCV coinfected patients.Stratification of patients according to their individual risk of developing cirrhosis and portal hypertension has become a major health issue in HCV monoinfection and HIV/HCV coinfection. In the era of IFN-free, DAA-based therapies that can cure up to 95% of all HCV infections [6–8], the main limitation of initiating HCV-treatment has shifted from side effects and contraindications [35] to socioeconomic issues (costs) [8]. Thus, predictors of disease progression to optimize treatment prioritization are of important clinical relevance.Fibrosis progression rate has been extensively studied in HIV/HCV coinfected patients within the last years [4,9,24,36] but genetic predictors for high FPR have yet to be investigated [36]. Although paired liver biopsy samples are still considered a gold standard to assess fibrosis progression [36], non-invasive tests have been validated for staging liver fibrosis in HIV/HCV coinfection and have developed into the standard tool in clinical practice [37]. In our study, we used both liver biopsy and transient elastography to assess liver fibrosis [38].PNPLA3 SNPs were associated with increased liver fibrosis progression in HCV-monoinfection [39,40], HIV-monoinfection [41] and other etiologies of liver disease [20]. Interestingly, even though we observed an increased inflammatory activity in patients harbouring a risk allele as reflected by the elevated transaminases, in our study there was no significant impact of a PNPLA3 risk allele on fibrosis progression or on the development of advanced fibrosis—neither in an univariable nor in a multivariable model. While PNPLA3 was not associated with advanced fibrosis in our cohort of HIV/HCV coinfected patients, HCV-GT3, age and BMI were independently associated with advanced liver fibrosis. Although there was only a trend toward a higher risk of advanced liver fibrosis in patients with low CD4+ nadir, we would not challenge the relevance of CD4+ nadir as a determinant of liver disease progression. As liver disease progression in this special population of HIV/HCV coinfected patients is accelerated due to several mechanisms including an altered cytokine environment, higher levels of reactive oxygen species [42], impaired cellular immune system [5], and other consequences of HIV infection [43], it seems that in HIV/HCV coinfection an additional “hit” of PNPLA3 high risk genotype does not have a significant impact. This hypothesis is supported by the similar prevalence of portal hypertension among the different PNPLA3 genotypes.The presence of hepatic steatosis accelerates liver fibrosis progression in HCV monoinfection as well as in HIV/HCV coinfection [44,45]. Several risk factors for liver steatosis, such as increased body weight, HCV-GT3, insulin resistance and other hallmarks of the metabolic syndrome [46] have already been established. In our HIV/HCV coinfected patient cohort we used the CAP™-Module of the FibroScan® device for evaluation of steatosis [47]. CAP has been validated for patients with HCV monoinfection by Sasso et al. showing that a CAP-value ≥222dB/m identifies patients with significant hepatic steatosis [30]. In accordance with previous studies describing a prevalence of hepatic steatosis of 24–75% in HIV/HCV coinfected patients [46,48,49], 52.9% of our patients had significant hepatic steatosis. When comparing patient groups with different PNPLA3-genotype, we could not find a difference in the prevalence of hepatic steatosis across the groups. A recent study by Ampuero et al. [33] showed a significant influence of PNPLA3 G-allele on steatosis in HCV monoinfected patients being infected with HCV GT1, but not in those with HCV GT3 infection. Following this finding we performed another analysis after exclusion of HIV/HCV GT3 patients—but the results were comparable to those obtained from the entire cohort. The majority of our patients was young, had non-adipose BMI, and only very few patients had diabetes mellitus (n = 10, 5.65%). We might speculate that in non-adipose young patients with HIV/HCV coinfection other causes of liver steatosis such as HCV GT3 or metabolic factors might play a more important role than the PNPLA3 genotype. However, the conclusion that the presence of a PNPLA3 risk allele has no impact on development of significant liver steatosis in HIV/HCV coinfection is limited by the low patient number in this subgroup analysis.Even in the era of DAAs, the former standard therapy for chronic hepatitis C (CHC)-treatment, PEGIFN/RBV, remains important and will continue to be used in resource-limited settings. Well-established factors predicting virological response to PEGIFN/RBV-treatment in HIV/HCV coinfection include HCV GT, HCV-RNA, IL28B [26], liver fibrosis, insulin resistance, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol-levels[50], low CD4+ counts and nadirs [51] and y-glutamyltransferase (GGT) levels [50]. Previous studies showed no impact of PNPLA3 high risk alleles on treatment outcome in unselected CHC patients [23], but in a selected subgroup of HCV GT 1/4-patients with advanced fibrosis [52]. Thus, we also analyzed SVR rates in our HIV/HCV coinfected patients receiving PEGIFN/RBV therapy stratified by IL28B and PNPLA3-polymorphisms. No statistically significant differences in treatment outcomes were observed. However, all 4 patients with the PNPLA3 major risk genotype G/G in the group with IL28B C/C genotype achieved SVR, indicating that the presence of a PNPLA3 risk allele does at least not impair virological response in patients with favorable IL28B genotypes.In summary, the PNPLA3 (rs738409) SNP is neither associated with faster liver fibrosis progression, nor with advanced fibrosis nor significant hepatic steatosis in HIV/HCV coinfection. Moreover, HIV/HCV coinfected patients with a PNPLA3 risk allele are not at increased risk for development of portal hypertension and show similar SVR rates to PEGIFN/RBV therapy.As the prevalence of the PNPLA3-high risk genotype (G/G) is reported to be very low in European CHC collectives (3–12% [23,39,53], being 5.1% in our cohort and 5.4% in another Austrian collective[40]) and the presence of a high-risk PNPLA3 allele did not show any impact on liver disease progression in HIV/HCV coinfection, we would not recommend to use PNPLA3 genotyping in daily clinical routine."
