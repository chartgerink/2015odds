"IFN-λ inhibits HCV replication in persistently infected cells and IFN-α-resistant sub-genomic replicon cell culture models
This study investigated the mechanism of sustained inhibition of HCV replication in cell cultures by IFN-λ1 as compared to IFN-α. Persistently infected HCV cultures were treated with equivalent concentrations of IFN-α or IFN-λ1, and antiviral activities were compared by measurements of HCV replication via levels of Renilla luciferase (RLuc). We found that inhibition of HCV replication by IFN-λ1 was more significant in persistently infected cultures as compared to inhibition by IFN-α. The results are consistent with our previous findings that indicate that IFN-λ1 inhibits HCV replication in persistently infected cultures in a time- and dose-dependent manner (Fig 1A and 1B). Concentrations of IFN-α of 100, 250, and 500 IU/ml were equivalent to concentrations of IFN-λ1 of 10, 25, and 50 ng/mL, respectively [27]. Only 70% of the cells expressed the HCV core protein, indicating that down-regulation of IFNAR1 may not be uniform in HCV-infected hepatic Huh-7.5 cell culture [27]. In this study, we used an IFN-α resistant sub-genomic replicon cell line previously described in [30]. This model was used to avoid the possibility of uneven down-regulation of IFNAR 1 in the infected culture (which could affect our data analysis) and thus to investigate the IFN-λ-specific antiviral mechanism. To verify that the IFN-response was different in the two cell lines, S3-GFP and R4-GFP cells in the culture were treated with increasing doses of IFN-λ1 (1–100 ng/mL) or IFN-α (10–1000 IU/mL) for 72 h. The antiviral effects were compared using assays that measured sub-genomic RNA replication (G-418 resistant colony assay) (Fig 1C and 1D), quantification of viral proteins (by flow analysis of green fluorescent protein; GFP) (Fig 1E and 1F), and viral RNA levels by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (Fig 1G and 1H). The results indicated that IFN-α inhibits HCV replication in the S3-GFP replicon model but not in the R4-GFP cell line, but that IFN-λ1 inhibits HCV replication in both cell lines (S3-GFP and R4-GFP). 10.1371/journal.pone.0141655.g001

(A) Persistently infected HCV (JFH1ΔV3-Rluc) cultures were treated with equivalent concentrations of IFN-λ1 (25 ng/ml) or IFN-α (250 IU/mL). Aliquot of infected cells were collected at every 24 hours and HCV replication was measured by Renilla luciferase activity. (B) Persistently infected HCV cultures were treated with increasing concentrations of IFN-α (100–500 I.U/mL) or IFN-λ (10-50ng/mL), HCV replication was measured at 24 hours.

The success of antiviral treatment was determined by the decrease in the number of the resistant colony.

IFN-λ activates the Jak–Stat signaling pathway in an IFN-α-resistant HCV cell culture
Binding of IFNs to receptors at the cell surface leads to activation of Jak family kinases, which then phosphorylate Stat proteins. The phosphorylated Stat proteins enter the nucleus and bind to specific DNA elements and thus direct ISG mRNA transcription. To determine if IFN-α or IFN-λ treatment results in activation of the Jak–Stat signaling pathway in R4-GFP cells, S3-GFP and R4-GFP cells were treated with IFN-α or IFN-λ1; then, phosphorylation of Jak1 was measured by Western blot analysis. Results of this experiment indicated that both IFN-α and IFN-λ induce Jak1 phosphorylation in the S3-GFP cell line, whereas only IFN-λ1 induces Jak1 phosphorylation in the R4-GFP cell line (Fig 2A). We then examined IFN-λ1 antiviral activity in R4-GFP cells in the presence and absence of pyridone-6, a Jak inhibitor, using flow analysis (Fig 2B). Pretreatment with Jak1 inhibitor prevented IFN-λ1 antiviral activity against HCV. To determine if IFN treatment could induce Stat 1 and Stat 2 phosphorylation, S3-GFP and R4-GFP cells were treated with equivalent concentrations of IFN-α or IFN-λ1 for 30 minutes. Cells were lysed and Stat phosphorylation was measured by Western blot analysis (Fig 2C). Both IFN-α and IFN-λ1 activated Stat 1 and Stat 2 phosphorylation in S3-GFP cells, whereas only IFN-λ1 induced phosphorylation of Stat 1 and Stat 2 in R4-GFP cells; IFN-α did not induce Stat 1 or Stat 2 phosphorylation in R4-GFP cells. We examined whether Type III IFNs also utilize an alternative circuit besides the Jak–Stat signaling pathway [31, 32]. The S3-GFP and R4-GFP cells were treated with IFN-λ1 and activation of different signaling pathways was examined by Western blot analysis. The results indicate that IFN-λ activates mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling and Akt phosphorylation in S3-GFP and R4-GFP cells (Fig 2D). 10.1371/journal.pone.0141655.g002
Fig 2 IFN-λ activates the JAK-STAT pathway in R4-GFP and S3-GFP cells.
(A) R4-GFP and S3-GFP cells treated with IFN-α (1000 I.U/ml) or IFN-λ (100 ng/ml) for 5, 10 or 30 minutes and Jak phosphorylation was measured by Western blot analysis. (B) R4-GFP cells were treated with a pan-Jak inhibitor (6-Pyridone) for 1 hour prior to IFN-λ (100ng/mL) treatment and after 72 hours the antiviral effect was measured by FACs analysis. (C) STAT1 and STAT2 phosphorylation was determined by 30 minutes treatment of R4-GFP and S3-GFP cells with increasing doses of IFN-α or IFN-λ. (D) S3-GFP and R4-GFP cells were treated with 100ng/mL of IFN-λ and cells were collected at different time points after treatment. Western blotting was performed using antibodies targeting the p38, p-JNK, p-ERK and p-αKT and PKC and beta-αctin. It is known that a complex of phosphorylated Stat 1 and Stat 2 proteins plus IRF 9 enters the nucleus and binds to the interferon stimulated response element (ISRE) promoter of IFN-responsive genes to initiate antiviral gene transcription. We verified whether IFN-λ1 also activates ISRE-luciferase reporters in S3-GFP and R4-GFP cells using a transient transfection assay (Fig 3A); IFN-λ1 activated ISRE-luciferase expression in R4-GFP cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 3B). To verify that both IFN-λ1and IFN-α produce their antiviral activity through the induction of ISGs, we compared the induction of selected ISGs in S3-GFP and R4-GFP cells after IFN-α and IFN-λ1 treatment. The S3-GFP and R4-GFP cells were treated with increasing concentrations of IFN-λ1 or IFN-α, and tested for the activation of known ISGs such as PKR, MXA, and OAS 1; mRNA levels were measured by real-time quantitative RT-PCR. The IFN-α and IFN-λ1 induced expression of ISGs in S3-GFP cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 3C and 3E), whereas only IFN-λ treatment showed ISG induction in R4-GFP cells (Fig 3D and 3F). The induction of ISGs by both IFNs in S3-GFP and R4-GFP cell lines was verified by Western blot analysis (Fig 3G and 3H). Taken together, these analyses suggest that IFN-λ1 inhibits HCV replication in R4-GFP cells through activation of the Jak–Stat signaling pathway. These results are consistent with those of a previous report, indicating that IFN-λ1 utilizes the same Jak–Stat pathway as used by IFN-α to inhibit HCV replication in cell culture models [25]. 10.1371/journal.pone.0141655.g003
Fig 3 IFN-λ activates the ISRE promoter and induces antiviral ISGs in S3GFP and R4GFP cells.
(A) S3-GFP cells were transfected with either an ISRE-Luc reporter plasmid or a control EGFP-Luc plasmid and treated with increasing doses of IFN-α or IFN-λ. Cells were collected 24 hours post transfection and Firefly luciferase activity was measured. Values were normalized with one microgram of protein and expressed as fold increase over the control. (B) R4-GFP cells were transfected with pISRE-Luc plasmid and treated with increasing doses of IFN-α or IFN-λ. After 24 hours, firefly luciferase activity was measured. (C and D) S3-GFP and R4-GFP cells were treated with increasing doses of IFN-α for 24 hours then the expression of ISGs mRNA level was quantified by qRT-PCR. The value of each sample was normalized to GAPDH and the expression levels relative to the untreated control were calculated. (E and F) S3-GFP and R4-GFP cells were treated with IFN-λ for 24 hours; the expression of ISG mRNA was measures by real-time RT-PCR. The value of each sample was normalized to GAPDH and the expression levels relative to the untreated control were calculated (G and H). The protein levels of the ISGs were evaluated by Western blot in S3GFP and R4GFP cells treated with 100 I.U/mL of IFN-α or 10ng/mL of IFN-λ and collected every 24 hours for 72 hours. MicroRNA array provides evidence that IFN-λ decreases miR-122 transcription in R4-GFP cells
MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNA molecules that inhibit expression of target genes through a variety of mechanisms, by partially binding to complementary sites in specific messenger RNAs (mRNAs) through base pairing. MicroRNAs play a critical role in inflammation, interferon signaling, and antiviral mechanisms [33]. To understand their role in inducing HCV clearance by IFN-λ, we generated a microRNA profile for R4-GFP cells with and without IFN-λ1 treatment. This analysis revealed significant up-regulation and down-regulation of microRNA expression in R4-GFP cells after IFN-λ1 treatment (Fig 4A and 4B, S1 and S2 Datasets). The most interesting microRNAs are microRNA-122 (miR-122), and microRNA-24 (miR-24). MicroRNA-122 is expressed predominantly in the liver through multiple functions, including cholesterol metabolism, fatty acid biosynthesis, and support of HCV replication; it is known to be required for HCV replication, and our results described below show that HCV clearance by IFN-λ1 treatment is associated with a four-fold decrease in miR-122 levels in R4-GFP cells. The significance of our results is supported by previous studies that indicate that inhibition of miR-122 induces HCV clearance in chimpanzees [21]. The array results showing decreased expression of miR-122 expression in R4-GFP cells after IFN-λ treatment were confirmed by Northern blot analysis (Fig 4C); we found comparable miR-122 levels in untreated and IFN-α-treated R4-GFP cells. The decreased expression of miR-122 was quantified using real-time RT-PCR in S3-GFP cells, R4-GFP cells, and persistently HCV-infected cells after 6 hours of IFN treatment. Our analysis show that IFN-λ1 treatment significantly decreased miR-122 levels in S3-GFP, R4-GFP, and HCV-infected cells (Fig 4D), whereas IFN-α treatment decreased miR-122 levels in S3-GFP cells and infected cells (Fig 4E). 10.1371/journal.pone.0141655.g004

(C) Northern blot for miR-122 in R4-GFP cells treated with either IFN-α or IFN-λ for 6 hours. (D and E) S3-GFP, R4-GFP and persistently HCV infected Huh 7.5 cells were treated with either IFN-α (1000 IU/mL) or IFN-λ1 (100 ng/mL) for six hours. One microgram of total RNA was used for the measurement of miR-122 by real-time RT-PCR. (F and G) R4-GFP cells were transfected with increasing concentrations (25–100 pmole) of miR-122 mimic for 24 hours and then treated with IFN-λ for 48 hours. The effect of the mimic on the antiviral action of IFN-λ was assessed by fluorescence microscopy and then GFP positive cells were quantified by flow cytometry. (H and I) MiR-122-Luc promoter construct was transfected into S3-GFP and R4-GFP cells and following the transfection step, cells were treated with either IFN-α (1000 IU/mL) or IFN-λ (100ng/mL) for 6 hours. The effect of the treatment on the promoter activity was measured by comparing the fold change of firefly luciferase in the treated cells over the untreated control, *p≤0.05, **p≤0.001. Another set of control experiments was performed to verify that miR-122 is involved in antiviral mechanisms of IFN-λ in an HCV cell culture model. We first determined whether over-expression of miR-122 mimic in R4-GFP cells could block the antiviral effect of IFN-λ. The R4-GFP cells were transfected with either miR-122 mimic or the scrambled oligonucleotide using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). After 24 hours, R4-GFP cells were treated with IFN-λ1 (100 ng/mL) for an additional 72 hours. Anti-HCV effects were determined by fluorescence microscopy and then quantified by flow analysis. Results (Fig 4F and 4G) indicate that miR-122 mimic blocked the antiviral effect of IFN-λ1. To test the effect of IFN-λ1 on the miR-122 promoter, we used a luciferase plasmid containing the miR-122 promoter sequence, as described previously [34]; IFN-λ1 decreased the promoter activity of miR-122 in both S3-GFP and R4-GFP cells (Fig 4I), while IFN-α decreased the activity of the miR-122 promoter in S3-GFP only (Fig 4H). These results confirm that IFN-λ1 treatment decreased miR-122 transcription in R4-GFP cells. Decreased miR-122 transcription in IFN-λ-treated culture mediated by the HNF4α–Stat 3 feedback loop
Hepatic nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4α), a highly conserved member of the steroid/thyroid superfamily of transcription factors expressed in the liver, has been shown to positively regulate transcription by directly binding to miR-122 promoters [24]. To examine whether IFN treatment can reduce the expression of HNF4α, S3-GFP and R4-GFP cells were treated with IFN-α or IFN-λ for 4 hours, after which total RNA was isolated and HNF4α mRNA levels were quantified by real-time RT-PCR. As predicted, both IFNs inhibited HNF4α levels after 1 hour and 4 hours in S3-GFP cells (Fig 5A); however, HNF4α mRNA levels decreased in R4-GFP cells only after IFN-λ1 treatment (Fig 5B). Western blot analysis verified that IFN-λ1 inhibited HNF4α levels in R4-GFP cells, whereas both IFN-α and IFN-λ1 decreased expression of HNF4α in S3-GFP cells (Fig 5C). It has been shown that HNF4α binds to two core sites (DR1) in the miR-122 promoter [24]; thus, a DNA pull-down assay was performed to test if IFN-λ1 treatment decreased the binding of HNF4α at the DR1 sites in the miR-122 promoter. The IFN-λ1 treatment decreased the binding of HNF4α at both DR1 sites, as compared to the response in untreated R4GFP cells or cells treated with IFN-α (Fig 5D). To determine if this effect was specific to HNF4α, the same membrane was incubated with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) antibody; PPARγ is another nuclear receptor known to bind to the DR1 sites in the miR-122 promoter [35]. The IFN-λ treatment did not decrease the binding of PPARγ to the DR1 sites (Fig 5D and 5E); however, IFN-λ1 treatment decreased expression of HNF4α, which resulted in reduced binding to the DR1 sites, leading to decreased transcription of miR-122. 10.1371/journal.pone.0141655.g005
Fig 5 IFN-λ1 decreases miR-122 transcription through down regulation of HNF4α.
(A and B) S3-GFP and R4-GFP cells were treated either IFN-α (1000 I.U/mL) or IFN-λ (100ng/mL). Cells were harvested at 1, 4 and 24 hours and then HNF4α mRNA levels were measured by real-time RT-PCR. (C) Protein levels of HNF4-α measured by Western blot in R4-GFP and S3-GFP after 4 hours of treatment with either 1000 IU/mL of IFN-α or 100ng/mL of IFN-λ. (D) Equal amount of cell lysates from R4-GFP cells were incubated with biotinylated double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to the two DR1 motifs in miR-122 promoter and with sterptavidin-agarose beads. The precipitated complexes were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting for HNF4α and PPAR-γ. (E) Quantification of the bands in Fig 5D (F) Schematic representation of putative HNF4α binding sites in human miR-122 gene promoters and the mechanisms for how IFN-λ1 decreases miR-122 transcription through reduced binding of HNF4α to DR1 element, **p≤0.01, ***p≤0.001. The proposed mechanisms for decreased miR-122 expression by IFN-λ1 are summarized in Fig 5F. Of the microRNAs that are regulated by IFN-λ, Stat 3-inducible miR-24-5p shows a 2.1-fold up-regulation in our array (Fig 4A). Other laboratories have reported that the miR-24 promoter contains a putative Stat 3 binding site, allowing Stat 3 to induce miR-24 transcription, and that HNF4α expression is regulated by the binding of miR-24-3p to its 3′ untranslated region (3′UTR) [36].
Based on our array results, we hypothesize that Stat 3 activation by IFN-λ1 decreases transcription of miR-122 by inhibiting the expression of transcription factor HNF4α. To test this hypothesis, we examined the activation of Stat 3 in IFN-λ1 treated R4-GFP cells by Western blot analysis. As expected, a dose-dependent increase in Stat 3 levels was observed in both S3-GFP and R4-GFP cells after IFN-λ1 treatment (Fig 6A). To determine if IFN-λ1-induced-phosphorylated Stat 3 protein enhanced the nuclear translocation of Stat 3 in S3-GFP and R4-GFP cells, we transfected Stat 3-GFP plasmid Huh-7.5 cells and assessed nuclear translocation after IFN-λ1 treatment. The IFN-λ1 treatment activated Stat 3 and induced Stat 3-GFP translocation in uninfected Huh-7.5 cells (Fig 6B). Pre-treatment with Jak inhibitor blocked Stat 3 phosphorylation by IFN-λ in R4-GFP cells, but not p38 MAPK phosphorylation (Fig 6C). To determine if IFN-λ1 could increase transcription of miR-24 in HCV culture, S3-GFP and R4-GFP cells were treated with IFN-α or IFN-λ1 and the expression level of miR-24 was examined by real-time RT-PCR at 4 and 24 hours post-treatment (Fig 6D). Our results indicated that both IFN-α and IFN-λ induced expression of miR-24 levels in S3-GFP cells; however, only IFN-λ1 induced expression of miR-24 in R4-GFP cells (Fig 6E).To validate whether miR-24 can inhibit the 3’UTR of HNF4α in our cell lines, both S3-GFP and R4-GFP were transfected with a miR-24-3p mimic and a luciferase reporter plasmid harboring the 3’UTR of HnF4α. Indeed, the miR-24-3p decreased the luciferase activity of the HNF4α reporter plasmid in both cell lines, while it had no effect on the control plasmid. The results are expressed as the fold change in the luciferase activity compared to the negative control (Fig 6F and 6G). 10.1371/journal.pone.0141655.g006
Fig 6 IFN-λ decreases HNF4α through STAT3 mediated expression of miR-24.
(A) S3-GFP and R4-GFP cells treated with either IFN-α or IFN-λ for 30 minutes. Cell lysates were measured for pStat3 and total Stat3 activation by Western blot analysis. (B) Huh-7 cells were transfected with pSTAT3-GFP plasmid and cells were treated with either of IFN-α (1000 IU/mL) or IFN-λ (100ng/mL) for 1 hour. Nuclear translocation of the Stat3-GFP fusion protein was measured by fluorescence microscopy. (C) Treatment of R4-GFP cells with a Jak inhibitor prevented the effect of IFN-λ on STAT3 activation and but not the p38 activation. (D and E) S3-GFP and R4-GFP cells were treated with either with IFN-α (1000 IU/mL) or IFN-λ (100ng/mL). Quantification of miR-24 levels was done using qRT-PCR. (F and G) miR-24-3p mimic inhibited the luciferase activity of a reporter plasmid harboring the 3’UTR of HNF4α, while it had no effect on the control plasmid EGFP-Luc. (H). A STAT3 inhibitor (Stattic) specifically inhibits STAT3 phosphorylation in R4-GFP cells but has no effect on STAT1 phosphorylation. (I) Stattic prevents the down regulation of miR-122 by IFN-α and IFN-λ in S3-GFP cells 6 hours after treatment as determined by qRT-PCR. (J and K) Treatment of R4-GFP and S3GFP cells with Stattic prevented the inhibitory effect of IFN-λ on HNF4α, *p≤0.05, **p≤0.01. To determine if the activation of Stat 3 by IFN-λ-treated culture mediates the decreased expression of HNF4α, we measured HNF4α levels in R4-GFP cells in the presence and absence of the Stat 3 inhibitor Stattic, a small molecule know to specifically inhibit Stat 3 phosphorylation while having no effect on Stat 1 phosphorylation (Fig 6H). The S3GFP cells were pretreated with either Stattic or phosphate-buffered solution (PBS); 1 hour after treatment, the cells were treated with IFN-α or IFN-λ, and 6 hours after treatment, miR-122 levels were determined using quantitative RT-PCR. We were able to show that Stattic completely blocks the inhibitory effect of both IFNs on miR-122 (Fig 6I). Stat 3 inhibition also prevented IFN-λ1 mediated inhibition of HNF4α in R4-GFP and S3-GFP cells at the protein level (Fig 6J and 6K). Taken together, these results indicate that IFN-λ activates the Stat 3–HNF4α inflammatory circuit, in addition to the classical Jak–Stat antiviral pathway, thus leading to effective HCV clearance (Fig 7). 10.1371/journal.pone.0141655.g007
Fig 7 Schematic illustration of the anti-HCV mechanisms of IFN-λ involves two distinct pathways (The Jak-Stat and Stat3/HNF4α loop).
IFN-λ first binds to cell surface receptor that activates the Stat1, Stat2 and Stat3 activation. (i). The Jak-Stat pathway activation involves the heterodimerization of Stat1/Stat2 which complexes with IRF9 to form ISGF3. The ISGF3 complex binds to the ISRE element to induce interferon stimulated gene expression and inhibit HCV. (ii). The Stat3 activation by IFN-λ induced the expression of miR-24. MiR-24 decreases HNF4α expression through binding to the 3’UTR of HNF4α mRNA. Reduced expression of HNF4α decreases the expression of miR-122 which inhibits HCV replication. The purpose of this study was to understand the antiviral mechanisms by which IFN-λ1 inhibits HCV replication. Our results showed that IFN-λ1 (IL-29) strongly inhibits HCV replication in persistently infected HCV cell cultures, as well as in IFN-α-resistant replicon cell culture models. The R4-GFP sub-genomic cell line used in this investigation is an IFN-α-resistant replicon cell line, which does not respond to IFN-α treatment due to expression of a truncated IFNAR1 subunit. We found that IFN-λ1, a type III IFN, activates the classical Jak–Stat signaling pathway, inducing Stat 1, Stat 2, and Stat 3 phosphorylation, ISRE promoter activation, and ISG induction in IFN-α-sensitive as well as IFN-α-resistant cells. The IFN-λ1 induced anti-HCV effect is inhibited in R4-GFP replicon cells by the Jak inhibitor pyridone-6, indicating that the antiviral mechanism was initiated through the recruitment and activation of Jak kinases. These results are consistent with previous findings indicating that IFN-λ and IFN-α activate classical Jak–Stat signaling [22]. Chronic HCV infection impairs the IFN-α induced Jak–Stat signaling pathway through a variety of mechanisms [37]; IFN-λ1 induces a strong antiviral effect in the IFN-α-resistant replicon cell line, as well as in persistently infected HCV cultures. This finding is also consistent with observations made by other investigators, indicating that cross-regulation and sharing effects of type I and type III IFNs initiate Jak–Stat signaling [38, 39].We found that in addition to Jak–Stat signaling, IFN-λ also activates other signaling pathways, such as MAPK, Stat 3, and Akt signaling, a finding that is consistent with the results of other investigators [31, 32]. IFN-λ activates Stat 3 in IFN-α-resistant and IFN-α-sensitive cell cultures. We focused our investigations on understanding the antiviral mechanism initiated by Stat 3 through regulation of microRNA expression. Stat 3 is an 89-kDa protein that is activated by a number of cytokines, including type I and type III IFNs. Interferon-activated Stat 3 can form a homo/hetero dimer, which can then translocate to the nucleus where it binds to DNA and initiates gene transcription [40]. Stat 3 activation has been linked to the expression of miR-24 and decreased activation of the inflammatory HNF4α loop. The miR-24 promoter contains highly conserved binding sites for Stat 3 [36]. MicroRNA is a small single-stranded RNA with 21–23 nucleotides that regulates gene expression by base pairing with complementary mRNA sequences to inhibit mRNA translation or induce mRNA degradation. MicroRNA-122 is a liver-specific microRNA that supports HCV replication through a variety of mechanisms, and its expression level has been implicated in IFN-α and RBV antiviral treatment [21–23]. Suppression of miR-122 has been linked to development of human hepatocellular carcinoma [41]. It is anticipated that microRNA can act either as an inducer or repressor of IFN-λ induced antiviral activity. The role of microRNAs in regulating IFN-λ antiviral activity is currently unknown.To understand the role of microRNAs in IFN-λ antiviral activity against HCV, we performed a microRNA analysis of R4-GFP cells. Some microRNAs show a 2–9-fold increased expression, whereas expression of some microRNAs was reduced 2–7-fold after IFN-λ treatment. In our array results, we found that miR-122 expression is suppressed 3.55-fold. Our results revealed that Stat 3-inducible miR-24 expression is induced by IFN-λ1. MicroRNA-24 regulates the expression of HNF4α, which has been implicated in the transcriptional regulation of miR-122. Our array results motivated us to study the role of the Stat 3–HNF4α feedback loop in IFN-λ1 antiviral mechanisms. Consistent with the feedback-loop hypothesis, we found that IFN-λ1 activates Stat 3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation, and induces expression of miR-24. Induced expression of miR-24 decreased expression of HNF4α and miR-122 transcription; this was confirmed by showing that a Stat 3 inhibitor could block HNF4α activation and miR-122 expression. Experiments in our laboratory have confirmed induction of Stat 3 by IFN-α and IFN-λ1 [42], yet the role of Stat 3 in the antiviral mechanisms has not been well established. Our results indicate that IFN-λ activates the HNF4α inflammatory loop to suppress miR-122 transcription. These results provide a potential antiviral mechanism involving activation of IFN-α and IFN-λ to inhibit HCV replication by suppression of miR-122 transcription.Recently, it has been suggested that the Stat 3–HNF4α feedback loop is involved in inflammation and hepatic carcinogenesis [43]. Stat 3 activation has been implicated in the activation of this inflammatory loop in chronic liver disease (40). Stat 3 has been shown to be activated by the cytokine interleukin (IL-6) and by type I and type III IFNs. We have shown that the expression of IFN-α receptor-1 is impaired in chronic liver disease and liver cirrhosis due to ER stress and the autophagy response [29]. The expression of the IFN-λ receptor is restored in chronic liver disease as well as in cases of liver cirrhosis. The IFN-λ receptor is primarily expressed in epithelial cells, including in hepatocytes, but is absent in most hematopoetic cells [44]. In addition to IL-6, we have shown that IFN-λ also induces Stat 3 activation, indicating that IFN-λ activates this inflammatory circuit in the liver during chronic HCV infection. It has also been shown that HNF4α plays a role in the inflammation processes of the liver and hepatocellular carcinoma by regulating the transcription of miR-122 [44]. It has been reported that miR-122 loss leads to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma in knockout mice [41]; this implies that the Stat 3–HNF4α-mediated short-term suppression of miR-122 leads to viral clearance, whereas long-term activation of Jak–Stat signaling increases the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. It has been claimed that IL-6-mediated activation of the Stat 3–HNF4α loop is inhibited by miR-124, which inhibits the IL-6 receptor. This study provides further evidence that IFN-λ activates the Stat 3–HFN 4α–miR-122 circuit independent of IL-6, which may be important for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma due to chronic inflammation.Type I IFNs (IFN-α and IFN-β), type II IFNs (IFN-γ), and type III IFNs (IFN-λ1–3) levels are increased in cases of chronic liver disease; they are secreted by a wide variety of immune cells and are often produced by the activation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) as well as cytosolic nucleic acid receptors (e.g., retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5) [20, 43]. Serum levels of IFΝ-λ also increase in chronic liver disease. The genetics of IFΝ-λ strongly influences the pathogenesis of chronic liver disease. Our results are supported by a clinical study based on 4172 patients, including those with chronic liver disease with viral and non-viral etiology, indicating that the IL-28B C/C genotype rs12970860 exhibits higher susceptibility to hepatic inflammation and fibrosis [7]. The group with the IL-28B C/C genotype responded well to IFN-α and RBV treatment. Basic research performed in our laboratory has shown that IL-28B C/C genotype hepatocytes respond well to IFN-λ treatment and induce Stat 1 and Stat 2 phosphorylation, whereas T/T hepatocytes are unable to induce Stat 2 phosphorylation and antiviral effects (44). Based on this evidence, we propose that short-term activation of the Stat 3–HNF4α loop activates antiviral signaling. However, long-term activation of this loop could increase the risk of inflammatory liver disease, liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinomas."
