"Three of the four SNPs at the VDR gene (rs1544410, rs7975232, and rs731236) were in strong linkage disequilibrium and hence patients were categorized as non carriers/carriers of the allelic combination rs1544410C - rs7975232C - rs731236A, defined as the risk haplotype in agreement with previously published evidence [14]. The remaining SNP at the VDR gene (rs 2228570 TC) was not in linkage disequilibrium with the others and was included in the analysis as an independent variable.In the univariate analysis the following variables were significantly linked with therapeutic failure: older age, IL28B rs12979870T allele carrier state, higher viral load, viral genotype 1 or 4, higher GGT levels and lower serum cholesterol levels. These variables were included in the multivariate analysis along with the CYP27B and VDR SNPs and the risk haplotype. In the multivariate analysis, all variables previously identified in the univariate analysis were confirmed as predictors of therapy failure at a significance level equal to p<0.05, with the exception of advanced age, as was, in addition, the carrier state of the of the risk CCA haplotype (combined rs1544410C - rs7975232C - rs731236A alleles) (Odds ratio = 2.743 - 95% confidence interval = 1.313–5.731- p = 0.007). On the contrary, the carrier state of the minor T allele at VDR rs2228570 was significantly related to the probability of obtaining sustained viral response to therapy Odds ratio = 0.438 −95% confidence interval = 0.204–0.882- p = 0.021 (Table 2).10.1371/journal.pone.0074764.t002Table 2

CYP27B1and VDR gene polymorphisms were forced into the analysis.The probability of therapeutic failure (P) was estimated with the formula:where the substitution values were as follow: a : VDR rs10877012T: non carrier = 1; carrier = 0; b : VDR rs1544410BsmIC/rs7975232ApaIC/rs731236TaqIA haplotype: non carrier = 0; carrier = 1; c : IL28Brs1297860T: non carrier = 0; carrier = 1; d : Viral genotype: 1 or 4 = 1; 2 or 3 = 0; e : Viral loal: <400.000 IU/mL = 0; ≥400.000 IU/mL = 1; f : GGT (U/L); g : Serum cholesterol (mg/dL).The receiving operating curve (ROC) was plotted in accordance with the same model to establish specificity and sensitivity values (Figure 1). The best cut-off value for this model was 0.620 that provided a sensitivity of 78.3% and a specificity of 79.2% for predicting therapeutic failure.10.1371/journal.pone.0074764.g001Figure 1

In the analysis restricted to the 208 patients infected with viral genotype 1 the differences detected in the whole series remained significant in the multivariate analysis although at a lower level, both for the carrier state of the VDR rs2228570 T allele (Odds ratio for SVR = 0.469 (0.223–0.990). p = 0.042 and for the VDR CCA haplotype (Odds ratio for therapy failure = 2.179 (1.000–4.762). p = 0.044).This study reveals that a common nonsynonymous SNP in the VDR gene (rs2228570 T/C), which is studied here for the first time in chronic hepatitis C patients, is a predictor of the clinical outcome of combined interferon plus ribavirin therapy. This polymorphism causes a threonine-metionine change in the Vitamin D receptor and, in the multivariate analysis that included the most potent predictors of viral response to combined therapy at baseline, those patients carrying the minor T allele in homo- or heterozygosis obtained SVR at a higher rate than patients with the rs2228570 CC genotype (p = 0.015). Most of these patients were infected with difficult-to-treat viral genotypes (87.4% genotype 1 and 5.5% genotype 4). When the analysis was restricted to the subset of genotype 1 infected patients, these differences remained significant.In addition, we also analyzed three highly linked SNPs in the VDR gene previously studied by Baur et al. in 155 Swiss patients with chronic hepatitis C [12]. Only 62.9% of their patients were infected with genotype 1. These authors reported a significant association (p = 0.028) between failure of the combined therapy and the haplotype bAt. In our study we found that these three SNPs are in strong linkage disequilibrium (95%), leading us to categorize our patients as non carriers/carriers of the rs1544410C - rs7975232C - rs731236A allelic combination. Eighty three patients carrying this allelic assortment had a highly significant lower rate of SVR in multivariate analysis (Pc = 0.009).Vitamin D 1α-hydroxylase, the CYP27B1 gene product, catalyzes the synthesis of 1–25 (OH)2 Vitamin D, the active form of vitamin D that binds to the vitamin D receptor. Its immediate precursor, 25(OH) Vitamin D, is considered to be an adequate marker of vitamin D state [6], but not necessarily of vitamin D physiologic activity because a genetic-induced reduction of 1–25(OH) vitamin D synthesis may result in a functional deficit of vitamin D, as occurs in vitamin D-dependent rickets type I. However, in a recent study, the CYP27B1-1260 promoter polymorphism (rs10877012) also included in our study is not related with vitamin deficiency in children [26].The retrospective design of this study precluded us to determine serum vitamin D and hence to analyze the possible influence of the studied polymorphisms on serum concentrations of the vitamin. Available data on the CYP27B1-1260 promoter polymorphism (rs10877012) are contradictory, as Lange et al. suggested that this polymorphism could influence serum concentrations of 1–25(OH)2 vitamin D [15] whereas Kitanaka et al. [26] did not confirm such a relationship. However, these authors reported that the BsmI, ApaI, TaqI haplotype at the VDR gene (that we have designed as CCA haplotype) is found 5.61 times more frequently among Vitamin-D deficient Japanese children than in the control group. None of the Vitamin D-related polymorphisms included in our study was found to be related with serum vitamin D levels in a recent GWAS analysis [27].Lange et al. in a complementary study based on a greater series of CHC patients (701 cases), detected an association between CYP27B1-1260 promoter polymorphism (rs10877012) and the rate of response to antiviral therapy (p = 0.06) which reached significance (p = 0.02) when the analysis was limited to patients with the IL28B genotype associated with poor response [16]. In the present study we have not confirmed such association although the sample size of our study group was only a third of that included by Lange et al. A sample size of 370 cases (α <0.05; power >80%) would have been necessary to exclude unit from the 95% confidence interval of the observed odds ratio (1,539), which is similar to that found by Lange et al [16].Advanced liver fibrosis negatively influences the probability of response to antiviral combined therapy in chronic hepatitis C [27]. In the present study a liver biopsy was available in 163 (68.5%) patients, with data provided by transient elastography in other 39 patients (see table 1). Data on the stage of fibrosis were lacking in 36 patients and this kept us to include this variable in the multivariate analysis aimed to detect the possible influence of the studied vitamin D-related polymorphisms on the results of antiviral therapy. However, we found that the relative frequencies of the studied polymorphisms were quite similar in the group of patients classified according to their fibrosis stage as null-low (F0–F1) vs. moderate-advanced (F2–F4). (Data not shown).In this study, data on insulin resistance, that is a known predicting factor of therapeutic failure, are lacking. Prospective studies taking into consideration all these factors are warranted.We conclude that two polymorphic sites in the VDR gene that influence the response rate to interferon-ribavirin therapy in chronic hepatitis C exist. The association of these polymorphisms with the response rate is independent from other well known predictors of response at baseline that were included in the multivariate analysis as potentially confounding factors (IL28B gene polymorphism, viral genotype and load, age, and serum GGT and cholesterol levels). In addition to the mechanistic implications of alteration in VDR with regard to clinical response to interferon-ribavirin therapy in chronic hepatitis C, which deserves further studies, the use of these new criteria may add to the refinement in the prediction of clinical response based on ancillary baseline data."
