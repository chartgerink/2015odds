"Patient Enrollment
A total of 35 patients were diagnosed with AHC during the study period. The incidence of AHC was 2.1 cases per 1,000 person-years. Three patients who were lost to follow-up within 1 year after diagnosis of AHC were excluded from the analysis. No deaths or fulminant hepatitis were recorded during the study period. Spontaneous HCV clearance was achieved by 4 patients, including 2 patients in whom HCV clearance was achieved within 3 months of diagnosis of AHC. The median time between diagnosis of AHC and HCV clearance was 11 weeks (range, 7–31 weeks). Among the 28 patients who did not show spontaneous HCV clearance, treatment with PEG-IFN plus RBV was initiated within 6 months of diagnosis in 9 patients and between 6 and 12 months of diagnosis of AHC in 3 patients (6.1, 6.4 and 6.9 months, respectively), whereas treatment was not initiated in the remaining 16 patients due to cost (n = 7) or other comorbidity (depression, history of epilepsy) (Fig. 1). Patients’ Characteristics and Clinical Presentations of AHC
The characteristics and clinical presentation of AHC patients are listed in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. All patients were Japanese men, including 31 (96.9%) MSM. Twenty nine patients (90.6%) received antiretroviral therapy (ART) and HIV-RNA was well suppressed in these patients. Four patients (12.5%) had a history of IDU, whereas none had a history of occupational exposure to HCV or blood transfusion. Although there was no significant difference between patients with and without spontaneous HCV clearance, the IL-28B CC+TT genotype was rs12979860 and rs8099917 in all 4 patients who showed spontaneous clearance and none of the patients with IL-28B CT+TG genotype showed spontaneous clearance (Table 1).

The majority of patients with AHC (24/32, 75%) were asymptomatic at the onset of AHC. High ALT was identified incidentally at routine visit for HIV-1 infection, with subsequent tests confirming the diagnosis of AHC. Compared to patients who did not show spontaneous clearance, patients with spontaneous clearance showed more severe clinical presentation of hepatitis (symptomatic, with higher serum total bilirubin and ALT value at diagnosis). The most frequent HCV genotype was 1b (70.4%). At diagnosis, HCV RNA was higher than 5.0 LC/mL in 24 out of 26 patients (Table 2). Response to Treatment with PEG-IFN Plus RBV
Treatment with PEG-IFN plus RBV was initiated in 12 patients within 1 year of diagnosis of AHC (median interval from AHC diagnosis, 3.2 months). We assessed the response to treatment in only 11 patients; the other patient was lost to follow-up within two weeks of treatment initiation (Fig. 1, Table 3). SVR was achieved in 9 of 11 patients (81.8%) despite the high incidence of HCV genotype 1b and high viral load.

Two patients did not achieve SVR. Both patients were infected by genotype 1b with high viral load, and treatment was initiated within 6 months of diagnosis. One achieved viral clearance within 12 weeks (early virological response: EVR) but showed viral rebound at 15 weeks after completion of the treatment (relapser), whereas viral clearance was not achieved during treatment in the other patient (null-responder). Both patients were relatively older and their CD4 counts were lower, compared to those with SVR, although statistical analysis was not performed due to the small number of cases. In patients with SVR, the median time between initiation of therapy and clearance of HCV was 8 weeks (range, 3–16 weeks). Surprisingly, both patients with IL-28B CT+TG alleles achieved SVR despite genotype 1b and high viral load, although we could not compare the SVR rate among different genotypes since only one patient was infected with genotype 2a in this study. Histological Findings of AHC in HIV-1 Co-infected Patients
HBs antigen was negative and ALT was within the normal range in the year preceding AHC in all 6 patients, whereas HBs Ab and/or HBc Ab was positive in 5 patients. No pre-existing factors of liver fibrosis other than HIV infection were evident before AHC. Liver biopsy was performed in 6 patients before treatment with PEG-IFN plus RBV. The median interval between diagnosis of AHC and biopsy was 4.3 months (range, 3.3–6.1 months). Fibrotic changes were confirmed in 3 cases by hematoxylin-eosin staining and silver impregnation staining (Fig. 2, Table 3). These lesions were paler-staining by Victoria Blue stain, indicating that the fibrotic areas did not reflect chronic changes.

In the present study, we identified 35 cases of AHC during the study period and nearly all such patients (34/35) were MSM, and the most frequent HCV genotype was 1b (19/27). These findings are consistent with previous reports from other countries [11]–[13]. In this regard, a high incidence of HCV seroconversion in HIV-1 infected MSM was reported recently by two separate groups [11]–[13]. The same studies also reported that genotype 1b was the major genotype among their patients [11]–[13], and that HCV infection was frequently not detected during the acute phase and diagnosed only at the chronic stage mainly due to the lack of symptoms.Similar to the previous reports on AHC, 75% of our cases were asymptomatic, and only 6.3% of the study population showed mild elevation of serum ALT (100 IU/L < ALT <150 IU/L). In this regard, ALT elevation during acute HCV infection is often relatively transient, and therefore could be easily missed during routine clinical care. The need of regular screening for anti-HCV antibody in HIV-1 infected MSM is controversial, and the recommendations are different in guidelines from different developed countries [29], [30]. Our results emphasize the importance of regular ALT monitoring and HCV re-screening at the time of mild ALT elevation during follow-up, especially in high-risk populations such as sexually active MSM.There are few reports on the relationship between IL-28B CC+TT genotype and spontaneous clearance of HCV [21], [31]. In the present study, spontaneous HCV clearance was seen in 4 out of 26 patients with IL-28B CC+TT genotype, whereas no spontaneous HCV clearance was seen in all 6 patients with IL-28B CT+TG genotype. Although this difference could not be confirmed to be statistically significant due to the small number of patients (4 patients), this is, to our knowledge, the first report on the relation between IL-28B and spontaneous HCV clearance during AHC in HIV-1 co-infected patients in Asian population. Our study also showed that the severity of clinical symptoms was an important factor related to spontaneous HCV clearance. Further investigation is needed for a better understanding of the pathogenesis of AHC, especially factors involved in spontaneous clearance.The use of PEG-IFN plus RBV treatment for AHC within 6 months of diagnosis is now recommended for HIV-1 co-infected cases [17]–[19] although data on the response of HIV-1 infected individuals with AHC to the PEG-IFN plus RBV remain limited. One study reported spontaneous clearance of HCV between 6 and 12 months of diagnosis [32]. In this regard, it is sometimes difficult in the clinical setting to start PEG-IFN plus RBV treatment within 6 months of diagnosis because some patients have comorbidities and complications other than HIV and HCV. In our analysis, 9 of 11 patients (81.8%), including 2 patients whose treatment was initiated between 6 and 12 months of diagnosis, achieved SVR despite high rate of genotype 1b infection (SVR 90.0% among those with genotype 1b virus). Furthermore, HCV genotype 1b-infected patients carrying the IL-28B CT+TG genotype (n = 2), which is a predictor of poor response to the treatment of chronic HCV infection, achieved SVR. These results emphasize the advantage of the PEG-IFN plus RBV treatment for AHC.Little is known about the progression of AHC to liver fibrosis in patients with HIV/HCV co-infection [33], although rapid progression of liver fibrosis during the chronic phase is well recognized [3]. Fierer et al. [34] reported that the development of fibrosis occurs even in the acute phase of HCV infection in HIV-Infected men. In the present study with limited cross-sectional analysis of liver biopsies after AHC, fibrosis was detected in 3 out of 6 cases, which is consistent with the above report of Fierer et al. [34]. Moreover, SVR was not achieved in 2 out of 3 patients who showed liver fibrosis, whereas the other 3 patients without fibrosis achieved SVR (Table 3). These results emphasize the clinical importance of early diagnosis and early treatment for AHC in HIV-1 infected individuals.In conclusion, the potential of AHC should always be considered in HIV-1 infected MSM, even in asymptomatic case, who present with mild ALT elevation. Favorable response can be expected if anti-HCV treatment is initiated during the early phase. Further investigation is needed to determine the predictor(s) of spontaneous HCV clearance, appropriate timing of treatment initiation, and duration of treatment."
